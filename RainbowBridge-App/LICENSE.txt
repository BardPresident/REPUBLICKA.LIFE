Rainbow Warrior Lollipop License v1.0


1. Purpose

This license is made for the Rainbow Bridge Wrapper and similar tools.
It exists to keep power in children’s hands and prevent anyone from
profiting from harm.

2. Kids own everything

Children who use this app own their words, seeds, and stories.
Adults are only temporary guardians and helpers.

3. Permission to use

You may use, copy, and share this app and its source code for
NON-COMMERCIAL purposes, as long as you:

- keep this license file attached, and
- clearly credit “Rainbow Bridge Wrapper – Rainbow Warrior Lollipop License”.

4. No profit from harm

You may NOT use this app or its code to:

- make money or build commercial services,
- train systems or products that silence, monitor, or exploit children,
- bully, harass, or dox any person, especially children or survivors.

5. Lollipop rule for adults

Any adult using this app with a child agrees that:

- the child chooses whether to participate,
- the child can say “no” at any time,
- each use costs at least one lollipop (or agreed treat) for the child.

Breaking this promise does not void your legal rights, but it breaks this
license in spirit. Children remember.

6. Share-alike

If you change or extend this project and share it with others, you must
license your version under this same Rainbow Warrior Lollipop License.

7. No guarantees

This app is provided “as is”, without any warranty. Use it at your own
risk and with care for the people whose words it carries.

8. Jurisdiction

Where the law must interpret this license, it should be read in the most
child-protective way possible, in all places and systems.
