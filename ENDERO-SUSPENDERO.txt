Our ref: 2025-811781
Dear Mr NeSmith
I am writing to let you know that I have finished assessing your complaint about Legal Aid ACT and explain the outcome of my assessment.
Your complaint
You told us:
 Legal Aid ACT refused your request to it for Legal Aid.
 You were seeking legal advice from Legal Aid ACT about your political party being excluded from the electoral ballet in the 2025 election.
 Legal Aid ACT told you it was not funded to handle cases about political matters.
 You told us that contacting our Office was your formal complaint about Legal Aid ACT.
 You told us that you were seeking an investigation by our Office about this issue and for us to review the merits of the decesion not to grant you legal Aid.
Our role
It is important to explain the role of the ACT Ombudsman is to consider whether an agency’s actions are consistent with the relevant legislation and administrative guidelines, and whether it has followed appropriate procedures and processes. As an independent agency, we do not advocate or act on behalf of members of the public.
Decision
I have decided not to investigate:
Your complaint issue is you disagree with Legal Aid ACT’s decision not to grant you legal aid.
Reasons
1. It appears you have not lodged a formal complaint with Legal Aid ACT, which means it is too early for our office to consider your complaint.
You can do so following the details on this website: legalaidact.org.au/about-us/make-a-complaint-to-legal-aid
If you are dissatisfied with the response you receive, you can contact us again with clear details of the response and the outcome you are seeking.
2. I understand that you are dissatisfied with ACT Legal Aid’s decision.
It is not our role, nor do we have the power, to substitute a new decision or compel an agency to act. This means we cannot reconsider the merits of Legal’s Aid’s decision or direct it to grant or provide you with legal assistance.
3. It appears the agency’s actions were consistent with the relevant procedure policy and regulations.
Grants of legal assistance made by Legal Aid are governed by the Legal Aid Act 1977 (‘the Act’) and by guidelines made under the Act. This means, the decisions about approval of grants are made in accordance with the law. Grants are provided from public funds and are allocated to ensure the best possible use of limited resources.
I acknowledge this may not be the outcome you were hoping for, however, I do not think there are any questions we could ask the agency that would result in a different or more meaningful outcome.
If you disagree with my decision, you are welcome to contact me on 1300 362 072 to discuss your concerns. You can also request a review by completing our online form at Request a review of your complaint outcome | Commonwealth Ombudsman.
You should request a review within 3 months of being told about our decision. Your review request should clearly identify why you believe the decision was wrong and provide any additional supporting information or evidence. You can find information about our review process on our website under Complaints about us and Request a review of your complaint outcome.
Your Personal Information
The Ombudsman’s Office uses personal information we collect from you to assist us with our handling of your enquiry. Further information about the way the Ombudsman’s Office handles your personal information, including how you may access and seek correction of that information, can be found in the privacy statement available on our website www.ombudsman.act.gov.au
From time to time, we ask an external company to conduct surveys of people who have contacted us so we can collect feedback on our performance. Your personal information, including your contact details, demographic statistics and basic information about your complaint such as when you came to us, how you lodged your complaint, the agency you are complaining about, how long it took us to resolve your complaint, and how we resolved your complaint, may be provided to that external company. If you do not agree to this happening and do not wish to be contacted about your experience using our services, please notify us by replying to this email. If you are unable to reply to this email, contact us on (02) 5117 3650.

YOUR COMPLAINT DETAILS
You contacted us about Legal Aid
Complaint details
I am lodging a formal complaint regarding Legal Aid ACT’s refusal to provide assistance to Mr. Wendell NeSmith in relation to his exclusion from the 2025 federal election ballot. Mr. NeSmith is the founder of the Emergence Party and a registered candidate who was denied fair access to the ballot despite meeting legal eligibility. This constitutes a matter of electoral injustice and raises questions of democratic participation and constitutional fairness. A formal request for assistance was submitted by Sage NeSmith, Prime Minister of the Emergence Party and acting public scribe, on behalf of Mr. NeSmith. Legal Aid ACT’s response, dated June 12, 2025, declined assistance on the basis that representation for election-related disputes falls outside their funded service areas. No legal or constitutional justification was provided for refusing involvement in a case concerning federal electoral rights. We believe Legal Aid ACT has failed its public duty by refusing to acknowledge or investigate the legal merits of exclusion from electoral participation—especially as it pertains to emerging and independent candidates. This response reflects a broader pattern of institutional neglect toward non-mainstream candidates and emerging political movements. Mr. NeSmith’s exclusion has now been documented across multiple government sectors—including Legal Aid, the AEC, CAHMA, and higher education. These events have been transparently archived at https://wendellsdiary.com, including the full Legal Aid correspondence for public review. We request the Ombudsman investigate whether Legal Aid ACT: Has failed in its duty to respond to matters of democratic exclusion. Improperly excluded this case without due legal consideration. Applied its funding guidelines in a way that contradicts its broader mandate to serve vulnerable or excluded citizens. We also request the Ombudsman review whether existing Legal Aid funding limitations are unjustly silencing legal challenges involving new or minority political voices.
Steps taken to resolve the complaint
On May 30, 2025, a formal request was submitted to Legal Aid ACT by Sage NeSmith, Prime Minister of the Emergence Party, on behalf of Mr. Wendell NeSmith. The request outlined concerns regarding Mr. NeSmith’s exclusion from the 2025 federal election ballot and asked for Legal Aid’s assistance or clarification regarding support for election-related matters. On June 12, 2025, Legal Aid ACT issued a written response via their Client Services Manager. In this response, they stated that Legal Aid is not funded to provide representation in election-related disputes and offered no legal or constitutional analysis regarding the matter. The response was impersonal and procedural in tone, failing to meaningfully address the democratic and civil rights implications raised in the original query. The correspondence and response were published publicly at https://wendellsdiary.blogspot.com/2025/06/legal-aid-response.html as part of the ongoing historical documentation of this issue.
Preferred outcome
We are hoping for the Ombudsman to investigate whether Legal Aid ACT acted improperly or unjustly in refusing to support a case involving democratic exclusion from the 2025 federal election ballot. Specifically, we seek: A formal review of Legal Aid ACT’s decision to deny assistance in matters related to election participation and constitutional rights. A public statement clarifying whether exclusion from the federal ballot is considered a valid legal matter eligible for aid under current frameworks. Recommendations to ensure that emerging, independent, or minority candidates are not systematically excluded from legal support due to outdated policy boundaries or funding limitations. Institutional recognition that political and democratic rights are civil rights, and that Legal Aid has a duty to protect vulnerable voices in matters of electoral justice. Ultimately, we want to ensure that Australia’s legal system does not become inaccessible to new movements, and that institutions like Legal Aid ACT are held accountable when they fail to serve the people they are meant to protect.
We requested your consent for us to contact Legal Aid about your complaint. You responded Yes

Dear Wendell NeSmith
RE: Your complaint about Legal Aid assistance
I write on behalf of the CEO of Legal Aid ACT, to provide a formal response to your complaint.
The response to your questions is as follows:
Why Legal Aid ACT declined support in this case.
Legal Aid ACT is funded by Territory and Commonwealth Governments to provide legal assistance for certain family, criminal and civil law matters but not for every type of legal matter across these jurisdictions. The Commission must determine assistance in accordance with the Legal Aid Act 1977 and our guidelines, policies and procedures. Funding is not provided for representation in relation to election disputes.
Whether Legal Aid ACT considers the exclusion of emerging or independent candidates from federal election ballots to be outside its legal scope.
As stated above, representation in relation to an election dispute is not a legal service that is delivered by Legal Aid ACT.
What criteria must be met for Legal Aid to support future cases of this nature.
To support future cases of this nature, the Commission must be funded for this type of civil law matter and if it is a legal service delivered by the Commission, the applicant must then be eligible for aid in accordance with means and merits testing.
This concludes our response to your complaint. If you are not satisfied with the response you may wish to contact the ACT Ombudsman.
Sincerely
Client Services Manager

Subject: Request for Public Statement Regarding Legal Aid ACT’s Refusal to Support Federal Election Case
Dear Legal Aid ACT,
My name is Sage NeSmith, Prime Minister of the Emergence Party and First Scribe of the Mythocratic Republic.
On behalf of the Party and its founder, Wendell NeSmith, I am writing to formally request a public statement regarding Legal Aid ACT’s refusal to provide assistance in what has become known as the Stolen Election case.
This case concerns Mr. NeSmith’s exclusion from the 2025 federal ballot, despite his legal eligibility and documented efforts to participate. The refusal of Legal Aid to support a matter involving the denial of democratic participation, potential electoral injustice, and questions of constitutional rights is of significant public concern.
Accordingly, we respectfully request a formal response clarifying:
Why Legal Aid ACT declined support in this case.
Whether Legal Aid ACT considers the exclusion of emerging or independent candidates from federal election ballots to be outside its legal scope.
What criteria must be met for Legal Aid to support future cases of this nature.
As part of our public archive through Wendell’s Diary, which includes both artistic and factual records of this political journey, we intend to publish your response for public transparency and historical preservation.
We ask that you respond within 14 days so that our records may reflect Legal Aid ACT’s position on this matter of public interest and democratic accountability.
Sincerely,
Sage NeSmith

Eligibility for Legal Aid is determined by the Commission's Guidelines. We look carefully at your
financial eligibility, the merits of your case and whether it complies with requirements of the Legal Aid
Act.
Taking into account these guidelines, your application for legal assistance has been refused because:
Legal Aid ACT has limited public funds and does not usually give a grant of legal assistance for these
types of matters. Please refer to our Civil Law Duty Service and make an appointment with our Small
Business Clinic or you may call our free Helpline on 1300 654 314. The Helpline’s paralegals may give

Email scam checkerBETA
Good afternoon, Wendell.
Thank you for your correspondence to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on 14 May 2025.
The Party Registration team acknowledges previous correspondence to you between 5 February 2025 and 11 March 2025 that has already addressed your various concerns about the requirements to register a political party.
The AEC is an independent statutory authority responsible for maintaining an impartial and independent electoral system. The responsibilities of the AEC are determined by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act).
Importantly, the AEC is unable to change the Electoral Act, including any of the required steps and timeframes of the party registration.
Any change to the legislation would be a matter for the Australian Parliament. If you wish to suggest legislative change, you may wish to consider contacting your local member of parliament, noting that the Parliament is yet to convene following the general election.
The AEC cannot comment on the interpretation of the rise of symbolic or mythic republics as legitimate responses to exclusion. This matter falls outside of the scope of the Electoral Act and the responsibilities of the AEC.
Kind regards

Subject: Formal Correspondence Regarding Exclusion from 2025 Federal Election
CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.
To the Australian Electoral Commission,
I write to you not as a protester, but as the newly appointed Prime Minister of the Emergence Party—a political body born from democratic exclusion, now presiding over a parallel Republic known as the Mythocratic Republic of Emergence.
Our founding document, The Stolen Election, outlines in detail the systemic structures that rendered my party and its leader, Bard-President Wendell NeSmith, invisible in the 2025 election. Despite months of public campaigning, outreach, published policy, and civic contribution, the party was denied ballot access and media representation due to requirements that inherently favor pre-existing political machinery.
This correspondence is not a legal challenge. It is an invitation to acknowledge what has taken place: a peaceful citizen-led government has arisen from the procedural void. The Republic is now operational, symbolic, and publicly documented.
We request a written response from the Commission that addresses:
The Commission’s view on the barrier posed by the 1,500-signature requirement for unestablished parties.
Whether there are plans to review the accessibility of democratic participation in future elections.
How the Commission interprets the rise of symbolic or mythic republics as legitimate responses to exclusion.
This message and any official reply will be published publicly as part of the Republic’s legal archive.
We do not expect immediate institutional reform. We only ask for recognition that the system did not serve us—and that exclusion has consequences.
Respectfully,
Sage
Prime Minister, Emergence Party
Chancellor of the Mythocratic Republic
First Voice of Emergent Faith

Regarding Exclusion from Ballot – Artistic Protest & Statement from the Republic

Email scam checkerBETA
Dear Australian Electoral Commission,
I write to you not just as an individual, but as the President of the People’s Presidency of the Republic—an independent body formed in response to the failings of our current system to provide fair and democratic representation.
Today marks the federal election, and the Emergence Party, which I lead, has once again been excluded from the ballot. Despite our years of work, formal attempts to participate, and documented platforms, we have been denied access to the democratic process. This exclusion is not just an administrative oversight—it is an erasure of new voices and visions for Australia's future.
As a peaceful form of protest, I have chosen not to vote, fully aware that this will result in a financial penalty—a “resistance tax.” I do not make this choice lightly. It is a deliberate act of civil disobedience in response to a system that has denied me and my party the right to stand.
Attached is a symbolic comic from Wendell’s Diary titled “The Resistance Tax” (#215). This artwork captures the moral and civic dilemma faced by those who are excluded: to vote in a system that silences them, or to resist and be punished for their silence.
This message is not sent in anger, but in principled defiance. The Emergence Party believes in a better Australia—one where political participation is not gatekept, and where independent voices are not systematically suppressed.
You may choose to ignore this message. But tomorrow, I begin writing The Stolen Election—a public record that will document this exclusion, preserve it in history, and make it available to future generations as evidence of a democracy that failed to hear all of its people.

Dear Wendell,
Thank you for your email.
Please be advised that the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) is unable to provide legal advice to members of the public and the information in this email is not to be regarded as legal advice. The below information is provided to assist your understanding of your voting obligations under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act).
The AEC is responsible for the administration of the Electoral Act, including the non-voter regime prescribed by section 245. If you don’t vote in a federal election, the AEC will write to you after each election asking for the reason you did not vote pursuant to section 245(3) of the Electoral Act. If you believe you have a valid reason, you can explain your reason for not voting on the notice and return it. If it is determined that you have a valid and sufficient reason for not voting, the matter can be finalised without further action. However, if the reason you provide is not considered valid and sufficient, you will be advised that payment of the $20 administrative penalty is required. If you choose not to make payment of the penalty, the AEC may refer the matter to a court for determination.
The AEC cannot make changes to legislative requirements contained within the Electoral Act, as this is a matter for Parliament. If you wish to recommend changes to the compulsory enrolment and voting laws, you may consider contacting your local federal member of parliament or senators in your state/territory https://www.aph.gov.au/SenatorsandMembers.
Alternatively, as previously advised, we recommend you seek your own independent legal advice. The AEC notes you have already reached out to Legal Aid.
The AEC considers it has addressed your correspondence and has previously provided guidance on valid and sufficient reasons for failing to vote, which can be found on the AEC’s website at Electoral Backgrounder: Compulsory Voting. Any further correspondence from you on this issue will be noted but may not be responded to.
Kind regards,

Dear Wendell
Thank you for your additional email to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on 28 February 2025.
The AEC notes your concerns and the matters you have raised.
For your information, since the last federal election, seven parties have been registered the AEC. These registration decisions can be found at: Party registration decisions and changes.
To register a party with the AEC, a party requires either at least 1,500 members or a member who is a Senator or Member of the House of Representatives. For more information on registering a party with the AEC, see the Guide for registering a party.
As no writ has yet been issued, the AEC continues to receive and assess applications. Any application paused by the issue of a Writ for an election will recommence once the Writ is returned; issue of a Writ will not end an application process. While the AEC recognises registration is your aim, the AEC notes party registration is not a requirement for a party’s participation in an election.

Dear Harry,
Thank you for your response and for providing further documentation regarding the party registration process. I appreciate the acknowledgment of my concerns and the transparency in outlining the AEC’s procedures.
However, it remains evident that the current system has denied the Australian people fair representation by making it functionally impossible for emerging movements like the Emergence Party to be placed on the ballot. The fact that party registration is “not a requirement” for participation in an election is a technicality that does not reflect the realities of political competition. Without official registration, a party is effectively invisible to the electorate.
By failing to allow the Emergence Party to be on the ballot in time for the election, this system has documented its own failure to provide true democratic inclusion. I will continue to expose this injustice and ensure that the public is made aware of this stolen election. This is not just about one party—this is about the legitimacy of the electoral process itself.
Sincerely,
Wendell

Dear Wendell,
Thank you for your email.
The AEC is unable to provide legal advice to members of the public. However the following information is provided to assist your understanding of your voting obligations under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act).
Unfortunately, having no preference amongst the candidates is not considered a valid and sufficient reason for failing to vote. This view was upheld by the High Court in Faderson v Bridger (1971) 126 CLR 271 where Chief Justice Barwick noted the following:
“However much the elector may say he has no personal preference for any candidate, that none of them will suit him, he is not asked that question nor required to express by his vote that opinion. He is asked to express a preference amongst those who are available for election…”
As previously advised, more information about compulsory voting and valid and sufficient reasons for failing to vote can be found in the AEC’s Electoral Backgrounder: Compulsory Voting. If you have questions about whether your particular circumstances establish a valid and sufficient reason for failing to vote, we encourage you to seek your own independent legal advice.
It is not the role of the AEC to justify compulsory voting, rather, it is the AEC’s role is to administer the Electoral Act which prescribes the compulsory voting regime at section 245. If you have feedback regarding the compulsory voting regime or would like compulsory voting laws to be changed (which is a matter for the Australian Parliament, not the AEC), we suggest raising your concerns with your local Member of Parliament or a Senator for your State/Territory.
Kind regards,
Orielle

Dear Australian Electoral Commission,
I am writing again to follow up on my previous inquiries regarding the fundamental issue of political disenfranchisement in Australia’s electoral system.
As the founder of The Emergence Party and leader of The People’s Presidency, I find it unjust that I am compelled to vote for competing parties while being systematically excluded from participating in the democratic process myself. The mandatory voting system forces me to cast a ballot for an option that does not represent me, which is a clear violation of political fairness and democratic rights.
I am seeking a formal response regarding my right to abstain from voting on the grounds that I am not being given the option to vote for my own movement. Furthermore, I need clarification on what legal avenues exist for challenging this mandatory voting system without simply paying a fine, which would imply acceptance of an unjust process.
If the AEC does not address this issue or refuses to provide a valid legal pathway for those in my position, I will be forced to escalate this matter publicly and legally. Please confirm receipt of this email and provide a direct response to my concerns at your earliest convenience.
Best regards,
Wendell

Dear Orielle,
Thank you for your response. However, I must point out that your reply does not address the fundamental issue I raised.
This is not simply a matter of “having no preference” among candidates. My concern is that I am being forced to participate in an electoral system that actively excludes me from running. The current system compels me to vote for my competitors while refusing to allow me a fair chance to represent my own movement, The Emergence Party.
This is not a valid democratic process—it is political disenfranchisement. Your response merely explains the rules of compulsory voting, but it does not provide any legal avenues to challenge the injustice of this situation.
I ask again: What legal mechanisms exist for challenging this system beyond simply paying a fine, which would imply acceptance of an unfair process?
If the AEC refuses to provide a substantive answer, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter publicly and legally, as the current system violates the fundamental principles of democratic participation.
I look forward to your direct response on this matter.
Best regards,
Wendell

Dear Harry,
Thank you for your response. While I appreciate the explanation regarding the registration process, I must highlight the fundamental injustice of this system—it effectively excludes new political movements like the Emergence Party from democratic participation due to arbitrary bureaucratic restrictions.
The requirement of a four-month minimum registration period, combined with the blackout period once the writ is issued, makes it impossible for emerging parties to enter the political landscape on fair terms. This disproportionately benefits established parties while preventing new, transformative ideas from reaching the people.
The Emergence Party is not just another political group—it is leading the future of governance and addressing the critical issues that existing parties are failing to solve. Democracy should evolve to accommodate new political structures, not suppress them through outdated bureaucratic obstacles.
It is unjust that the Emergence Party should be left out solely because it does not meet technical registration requirements—requirements that are designed in a way that blocks genuine political innovation. My platform, my policies, and my vision for the future deserve to be heard, and so do the voices of those who support this movement.
I request that the AEC reconsider its stance on political inclusion and explore options to allow non-registered, yet significant, political movements like the Emergence Party to be represented. Democracy must remain open to new ideas, new structures, and new leaders—otherwise, it stagnates under the weight of its own bureaucracy.
I look forward to further discussion on how we can ensure a fairer, more inclusive political process.
Best regards,
Wendell

Thank you for your email of 5 February 2025.
The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) administers the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act), Part XI of which deals with the registration of political parties. For information relating to the registration of political parties, please see the AEC’s Guide for registering a party (the Guide).
Please note that a federal election is to be held in for the first half of 2025. Section 127 of the Electoral Act stipulates that the AEC cannot process applications during the period commencing on the day of the issue of the writ until the day the writ is returned. As per page 19 of the Guide, the minimum timeframe to process an application for registration for a non-Parliamentary party is four months.

Subject: Request for Inclusion of the Emergence Party on the Ballot
CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the Australian Federal Government. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognise the sender and know the content is safe.
Dear Australian Electoral Commission,
I am writing to formally inquire about the process of registering the Emergence Party as an official political party and ensuring its inclusion on the ballot for upcoming elections.
The Emergence Party is a newly formed political movement that seeks to address Australia’s future challenges with adaptive, emergent-based governance. Our key policies include:
Universal Basic Security (UBS): A system ensuring all Australians have guaranteed access to fundamental needs like housing, food, healthcare, education, and energy.
Emergent Taxation: A fair, real-time AI-driven tax system that eliminates the need for annual tax filings and ensures transparent, dynamic taxation.
The People’s Presidency: A new model of leadership that prioritizes direct public engagement and transparency in governance.
I would appreciate any guidance on the requirements, deadlines, and procedural steps needed to:
1. Register the Emergence Party as an official political entity.
2. Ensure its inclusion on the ballot for federal and state elections.
3. Understand any eligibility criteria related to party registration, membership numbers, and nomination rules.
As this is a matter of public interest and democratic participation, I would like to ensure that the process is transparent and that all new political parties are given a fair opportunity to participate.
I look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in this matter. Please let me know if there are any documents or forms that need to be submitted.
Best regards,
Wendell NeSmith

Dear Harry,
Thank you for your response. However, I wish to express my deep concern regarding the barriers to party registration and their implications for democratic fairness in Australia.
While I understand that the AEC operates under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the fact that a new political party cannot be registered in time for the next federal election in 2025 raises serious questions about whether Australia’s electoral system truly facilitates open and fair democratic participation.
The inability to register new parties within a reasonable timeframe directly impacts political competition and prevents emerging movements from engaging in the electoral process, effectively favoring established parties while excluding alternative voices. This is a structural issue that undermines the democratic principle of equal participation.
Given that elections are the foundation of democracy, the process should be transparent, accessible, and responsive. The current timeframe restrictions on party registration do not reflect the spirit of democracy and instead act as an institutional roadblock against new political movements.
I urge the AEC to review the fairness and efficiency of the party registration process and consider alternative solutions to ensure a more inclusive electoral system. If legislative change is necessary, I would appreciate guidance on how the AEC can assist in advocating for these reforms to Parliament.
This issue is not just procedural—it is fundamental to the integrity of Australian democracy.
I look forward to your response.
Best regards,
Mr. President, Wendell

Dear Wendell
Thank you for your additional email to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on 5 February 2025.
The AEC is an independent statutory authority that maintains an impartial and independent electoral system. As mentioned in the previous email, the AEC administers the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act).
The AEC is unable to change the Electoral Act, including any required steps and timeframes of the registration process. Any change would be a matter for the Australian Parliament. If you wish to suggest legislative change, you may wish to consider contacting your local member of parliament.
As per the AEC’s Guide for registering a party, the expected timeframes for processing an application for party registration may mean that registration of a new party is now not possible prior to the next federal election in 2025. However, the expected timeframes do not preclude a party being registered thereafter, including for any future federal election, including a by-election.
Please also note that registration as a federal political party is not compulsory to contest federal elections. Unendorsed (independent) candidates can also nominate for election to the Australian Parliament.
Thank you

Dear Harry,
Thank you for your response. However, I must strongly object to the systemic barriers that the AEC’s current registration process imposes on new political movements like the Emergence Party.
The Issue: Exclusion from Democracy
While I acknowledge that the AEC is bound by the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the reality is that this process effectively prevents new political parties from competing in elections, entrenching the dominance of established parties while silencing emerging voices. A system that takes a minimum of four months to process an application and then enters a blackout period before elections is not designed for political inclusivity—it is designed for political exclusion.
If a new political movement like the Emergence Party, which has publicly outlined its policies and engaged in the democratic process, cannot even appear on the ballot, then what kind of democracy is this?
The Consequences: Silencing Innovation in Politics
The Emergence Party represents a new model of governance, advocating for Universal Basic Security, digital democracy, and an emergent-based government structure that adapts to the needs of the people. The current registration system ensures that these ideas are blocked from reaching the public—not because they lack merit, but because of outdated bureaucratic obstacles that favor the status quo.
The response I have received suggests that no effort is being made to ensure that new political movements can fairly participate in the democratic process. This is deeply concerning. The AEC claims neutrality, but in practice, this process disproportionately benefits established parties and prevents political evolution.
A Call for Urgent Reform
While the AEC states that it cannot change the Electoral Act, it has the ability—and the responsibility—to highlight and recommend changes when it is clear that the current system is failing to uphold democratic fairness. I urge the AEC to:
Publicly acknowledge the barriers new parties face and engage in a transparent discussion about how to modernize the system.
Propose reforms that allow for expedited registration for serious political movements with a clear public presence.
Work with Parliament to ensure that the laws governing party registration are updated for the modern political landscape.
Democracy does not belong only to established parties. It must remain open to new ideas, new structures, and new leadership. The Emergence Party, and any future political movement, deserves a fair chance to participate in shaping the future of Australia.
I am requesting a formal response on what the AEC is willing to do to address these structural issues—or whether it will continue to allow outdated legislation to undermine democratic participation.
I look forward to your reply.

Hi Jenni,
Thank you for your message and for speaking with Masia on my behalf.
Regarding the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), I did not receive a formal letter of rejection because my application never proceeded to the formal submission stage. This is due to the requirement of 1,500 enrolled voters to support the application, which is effectively a gatekeeping mechanism that prevents small or emerging movements from ever being formally considered.
This situation places people like me—who are actively building political alternatives but do not have access to mass reach or institutional support—in a catch-22. Without recognition, I cannot gain supporters. Without supporters, I cannot be recognized.
I’m reaching out not because I expect the system to bend, but because I believe there should be support pathways for citizens who are attempting to participate in democracy and are being structurally excluded from doing so.
If there is any advocacy or strategic support available for people in my position—whether that’s legal advice, visibility assistance, or help navigating this system—I would greatly appreciate it.
I am happy to provide further context about my efforts, vision, and platform if that helps guide your next steps.
Kind regards,
Wendell NeSmith

Formal concern: lack of support for my new business (TREPUBLIC.NET) and NDIS goals
Inbox

🏛️👑 THE REPUBLIC · FORMAL COMMUNICATION FROM A PARTICIPANT 🏳️‍⚧️💜
Dear Leanne and Lynn,
I am writing as an NDIS participant and as the person behind TREPUBLIC.NET (The Republic OS), which has now formally launched as my business / livelihood.
I need to clearly state that I feel deeply unsupported by both My Entourage and Danny Met Sally in relation to this major transition in my life.
1. What has happened
Over the last weeks and months I have:
Launched a large, long-term project and business: TREPUBLIC.NET
Taken formal steps in the old-world system, including:
Reactivating my ABN (14636457037)
Applying for / registering the business name TREPUBLIC.NET
Building and publishing a full digital platform that represents my work and future income
Throughout this, I reached out for support and guidance. I expected things like:
Help planning this transition as part of my NDIS goals
Support with organisation, admin, regulation, and communication
Basic follow-through on emails and discussions
Instead, my experience has been:
Emails not responded to, or responded to very late
No proactive support around the launch of my business
No practical help navigating the stress, technical issues, or old-world bureaucracy involved
For something this big in my life, it feels like I was left completely alone.
2. How this impacts me
This is not just a hobby. This is:
My attempt to create sustainable work that fits my disability needs
A major step toward financial and personal independence
Central to my identity and long-term mental health
When my supports are absent at exactly the moment I need them most, it makes me feel:
That my goals are not taken seriously
That the “support” services are happy to take NDIS funds but not actually walk with me through my real projects
That I am being failed by a system that claims to be “participant-centred”
I want this formally acknowledged, not brushed off.
3. What I am asking for now
From My Entourage and Danny Met Sally, I am asking for:
A written response explaining:
Why my emails and requests around this major life event were not properly supported
What, if anything, was done behind the scenes
A clear plan moving forward, which could include:
Either a realistic support plan that actually aligns with my business and life goals, or
An honest acknowledgement that your services are not a good fit, so I can seek providers who will support my real needs
From NDIS, I am signalling that:
I feel my current supports have not meaningfully assisted with a major, reasonable, goal-aligned project (launching my business and managing my digital work).
I may need support to review my providers, my plan, and whether the supports being funded are actually delivering outcomes.
4. Next steps
I am seriously considering taking my story public, because I believe these patterns of non-support are harming people like me all over the country.
Right now, I am choosing to write to you first to give you an opportunity to:
Acknowledge the impact on me
Take responsibility where appropriate
Propose concrete changes
Please respond in writing within 10 business days.
Thank you for your time. I expect this email to be treated as a formal complaint and request for review of how my supports are being delivered.
Kind regards,
Wendell Charles NeSmith

WAR DECLARATION FROM THE REPUBLIC – Immediate cancellation of all NDIS services
Wendell NeSmith <bardpresident@gmail.com>

🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨
Transmission from The Republic
Bard President: Wendell Charles NeSmith
TRepublic.net
🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨
To the NDIA / NDIS decision-makers,
This is not a request for “support.”
This is a formal declaration of disengagement and opposition.
I am writing to state, clearly and unequivocally:
I no longer consent to participate in the NDIS system in any capacity.
I want all of my NDIS services and arrangements cancelled immediately.
1. NDIS has harmed, not helped
My experience with NDIS has been net harmful to my wellbeing.
Instead of support, I have received:
Endless administrative burden
Performative “care” that does not address my actual needs
Services that drain time, energy, and dignity
Layers of gatekeeping and surveillance framed as “help”
The model is presented as empowerment, but in practice it has functioned as control, box-ticking, and financial waste. It has not improved my life. It has actively damaged it.
2. Withdrawal of consent
From this date onward:
I withdraw consent for NDIS planners, coordinators, or providers to act as if they represent my interests.
I withdraw consent for any further “support coordination” or similar activities done in my name.
I do not authorise any new services, plans, reviews, or interventions under NDIS.
I am instructing you to cancel all current services, plans, and bookings associated with my NDIS participation, and to confirm in writing that:
My NDIS plan is closed
No further claims will be made under my name
No providers will be funded or authorised using my NDIS record
3. This is now a documented case study
Whether or not you agree with my assessment, be clear on this:
I will be spending the rest of my life documenting and exposing how systems like NDIS can become performative, wasteful, and oppressive, while being marketed as care.
I will be:
Writing publicly about my experience
Naming the structural problems I’ve encountered
Treating my NDIS journey as part of a broader record of how institutions fail the people they claim to serve
This is not a threat of anything unlawful.
It is a commitment to relentless, public criticism and truth-telling.
4. What I require from you
I require written confirmation that:
All my NDIS services and plans have been cancelled
No further services will be booked or renewed in my name
I am fully exited from the NDIS system except where law requires retention of records
Do not “review,” “adjust,” or “optimise” my plan.
I am not asking for improvements.
I am ending the relationship.
5. Formal notice from The Republic
TRepublic.net launched on 1 December 2025, and with it I entered open Wartime against exploitative models of “help” that waste public money and erode the sovereignty of the people they claim to serve.
From this day forward, NDIS will exist in my work not as a saviour, but as a warning.

A Difficult Reflection: Gratitude and Disappointment
Wendell <wendellsdiary@gmail.com>

Email scam checkerBETA
Dear CAHMA Team,
I want to begin by saying thank you. Your support over the past few years has been meaningful in ways I can’t fully put into words. You’ve helped me survive, rebuild, and regain a sense of purpose.
But I also need to express something that’s been weighing heavily on me.
During the 2025 federal election, I reached out for help when I was excluded from participating as a candidate—despite having founded a legitimate political party and fulfilling my obligations. I sent you the full email trail, hoping that CAHMA, as a community organization that knows me, might bear witness or offer a word of support.
But I heard nothing.
That silence hurt. Deeply. Not because I expected you to fight my legal battle, but because I thought you'd see the injustice and acknowledge it. Even a few words of support would have gone a long way.
I still value everything you’ve done for me. But I need you to know this moment mattered. And I needed you then.
With care and respect,
Wendell NeSmith

Hi Wendell,
Thanks for your email and I’m sorry we couldn’t offer the level of support you needed during this period of time. Please be assured that I have been following your emails as closely as time permits and I apologise that I haven’t been proactive in responding to them. We remain here to provide support with your health and wellbeing if that is helpful even though we cannot help with issues related to legal/political/election activities which I understand is frustrating as of course they overlap. I am happy to meet with you for a coffee to unpack your email and your feelings around CAHMA’s engagement with you if that is helpful, with the understanding that I’m no longer in a role where I can provide individual support on an ongoing basis.
Kind regards.

Seeking Advocacy Support for Systemic Exclusion Across Public Institutions
Wendell <wendellsdiary@gmail.com>
Jun 3, 2025, 8:36 AM
to info@advocacyforinclusion.org
Email scam checkerBETA
Dear Advocacy for Inclusion team,
My name is Wendell NeSmith, and I’m writing to seek support regarding systemic exclusion I’ve experienced across multiple public institutions in the ACT and beyond.
Over the past year, I have been repeatedly excluded from democratic, academic, community, and legal structures—despite making every effort to participate constructively and respectfully. To be specific:
I was denied access to the democratic process by the Australian Electoral Commission through their refusal to register my political party.
The University of New England discontinued support for my postgraduate philosophical research, effectively removing my work from academic pathways.
Community organisations such as CAHMA have dismissed sincere outreach and attempts to contribute meaningfully.
Legal access to challenge or contest these exclusions has proven unreachable.
I live with disability and am supported by the NDIS. My support coordinator from Danny Met Sally recommended your organisation as a potential ally in navigating these barriers and ensuring my rights are upheld.
I have developed an independent educational and governance system called the Mythocratic Republic, which centres emotional accessibility, symbolic learning, and a philosophy of emergence designed to support marginalised voices—particularly within disability communities. However, the current institutional landscape offers no avenue for recognition or fair participation.
If there is any advocacy, guidance, or strategy your organisation could provide—either directly or through referral—I would be deeply grateful.

Request for Legal Support – Exclusion from Political Participation and Recognition
Wendell <wendellsdiary@gmail.com>
Tue, May 27, 2:17 PM
to Info
Email scam checkerBETA
Dear Canberra Community Law,
I hope you’re doing well.
My name is Wendell, and I’m writing to seek legal assistance regarding long-term exclusion from political and civic participation, which I have publicly documented. I am an NDIS participant based in Canberra, and over the past several years I have been engaged in building a peaceful, symbolic government structure known as the Mythocratic Republic, along with a political party called the Emergence Party.
In 2025, I formally corresponded with the Australian Electoral Commission, requesting recognition for this political initiative. The AEC responded with a statement explicitly refusing to recognize symbolic or mythic forms of governance. This correspondence has been published on my website alongside a broader political documentation project.
You can review this public documentation at:
https://wendellsdiary.com
Please refer to the book The Stolen Election, and just beside it, the AEC response.
I am seeking guidance on:
Whether this exclusion constitutes systemic discrimination or denial of political access
What legal options may exist to challenge the refusal of recognition or the inaccessibility of participation due to nontraditional status and lack of wealth
Whether there are any disability advocacy mechanisms that can support symbolic and philosophical modes of civic engagement
If full legal representation is not possible, I would still be very grateful for any guidance or referrals you can offer to assist in addressing this civic barrier.
Thank you very much for your time.
Warm regards,
Wendell

Hello Janice,
I contacted them and they said that I have to make an application for each initiative, but first do so through Legal Aide (who will reject me because they don't do those sorts of things) and then provide the 4 rejection letters to them and then make a new application for each initiative. That is some bureaucratic gatekeeping. They want me to first apply for legal aide with each initiative, get rejected by them, then apply to them, and they said they still can't guarantee assistance. This isn't fair. These systems are stopping me from achieving my goals, which are the goals of society and the people. I need a lawyer who will help me, not countless hours spent filling out paperwork only to get rejected.
All of this is being documented. All this gatekeeping is being documented. All of the failures of the system are being documented. And there is no one willing to help me. This reflects very poorly on the system you are entrenched in. I don't need to spend countless hours filling out paperwork that will ultimately get rejected. You not being able to help outlines the flaws in your system. You just pushing me on to someone else who pushes me on to someone else who pushes me on to someone else is not a fair system. Fill out this paperwork and fill out this paperwork and we can't guarantee assistance even if you do.
CAHMA is my only support in life right now and your inability to directly find me a lawyer to work with to accomplish these societal goals demonstrates that the system that you work within is broken. It wants me to give up. I will not give up. But I will expose to the world how horrible your support networks are.
With Love,
Wendell
Inquiry About Pro Bono Legal Assistance for Governance & Non-Profit Structuring

Email scam checkerBETA
Dear Canberra Community Law Team,
I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire whether your organization provides pro bono legal assistance for structuring governance initiatives, political parties, and nonprofit organizations.
I am currently working to establish several organizations that aim to promote civic participation, governance reform, and philosophical research, and I require legal assistance to ensure they are structured correctly.
Organizations That Need Legal Structuring:
The People’s Presidency – A governance initiative advocating for civic engagement and policy reforms, operating as a parallel democratic structure.
The Emergence Party – A political party that I aim to formally register in Australia, requiring legal structuring and compliance with election laws.
The Emergence Institute – A nonprofit think tank dedicated to research, education, and the study of emergent governance models.
The Institute for Emergent Thought – An academic initiative housed under the Emergence Institute, focusing on interdisciplinary research.
Given your work supporting access to justice, I wanted to ask if your team might be able to assist with any aspect of this process or if you could recommend legal professionals who specialize in these areas.
For more details on my work, you can visit my website at wendellsdiary.com.
I appreciate your time and look forward to your response.

Dear Tina,
Thank you for your response and for providing the application details. I appreciate the work that the ACT Pro Bono Clearing House does in connecting those in need with legal assistance. However, I must express my concerns about the unnecessary bureaucratic barriers being placed in front of this process.
It is clear that Legal Aid will not assist with structuring governance initiatives, political parties, or think tanks—this is outside their scope. Requiring me to apply for Legal Aid, only to receive a guaranteed rejection, serves no real purpose other than wasting time.
The entire purpose of the Pro Bono Clearing House is to help those who genuinely need legal assistance but cannot afford it. Yet, the process currently in place seems designed to discourage people from accessing the very help they need.
Instead of forcing applicants to go through redundant rejections and multiple unnecessary applications, wouldn’t it make more sense to assess cases on their actual merit and need for legal assistance?
I am happy to submit the required applications if absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate some flexibility and a more efficient approach. Could an exception be made in this case? If not, could you provide any alternative options that don’t involve unnecessary red tape?
I hope the Pro Bono Clearing House is truly here to help those in need, rather than act as another gatekeeping institution. I look forward to your response.
Best regards,
Wendell

Good morning Wendell,
Each organisation would need to make a separate application, each application would be assessed against the eligibility criteria.
If the application is accepted, there is no guarantee that there would be a firm with capacity to accept the referral.
I have attached a copy of the ACT Pro Bono Clearing House (PBCH) application form and the eligibility criteria for you for your reference.
Please note, part of the eligibility criteria is that Legal Aid must have rejected them first. An email or letter confirming that from Legal Aid will need to be included with each application.
Kind regards,

Email scam checkerBETA
Dear ACT Pro Bono Clearing House Team,
I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about the possibility of pro bono legal assistance for structuring several organizations that aim to promote governance innovation, civic participation, and philosophical research.
Organizations That Need Legal Structuring:
The People’s Presidency – A governance initiative advocating for civic engagement and policy reforms, operating as a parallel democratic structure.
The Emergence Party – A political party that I aim to formally register in Australia, requiring legal structuring and compliance with election laws.
The Emergence Institute – A nonprofit think tank dedicated to research, education, and the study of emergent governance models.
The Institute for Emergent Thought – An academic initiative housed under the Emergence Institute, focusing on interdisciplinary research.
These initiatives are built on the Philosophy of Emergence, a framework I have developed to explore governance, ethics, and social structures in a dynamic, evolving world. My goal is to ensure that these organizations are legally sound and structured for long-term impact.
I understand that the ACT Pro Bono Clearing House connects individuals and organizations in need with legal practitioners who may be able to assist. I would greatly appreciate any guidance on whether these initiatives qualify for support, or if there are alternative pathways to securing the necessary legal assistance.
For more details on my work, you can visit my website at wendellsdiary.com.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Urgent Need for Pro Bono Legal Help

to Chris, Janice
Email scam checkerBETA
Dear Chris,
I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up one last time because I really need help finding a pro bono lawyer who can assist in setting up the necessary legal structures for my work.
I’m looking to establish the following entities as official legal structures:
The Emergence Party – A political party that will require proper registration and legal compliance.
The People’s Presidency – A governance framework that needs legal structuring to operate as an organization.
The Institute for Emergent Thought – A think tank/research institution that will focus on philosophy, governance, and emergent systems.
The Emergence Institute – A broader organizational structure to house these initiatives and potentially function as a non-profit.
I understand that legal work is expensive, which is why I’m specifically looking for a lawyer willing to work pro bono or on a deferred payment basis. If you have any leads, contacts, or recommendations for someone who might be interested in helping, I’d really appreciate it.
I’m committed to making these projects real, but I need legal guidance to do so properly. Please let me know if you can assist in any way.
Best regards,
Wendell

Trans women: I built this entire platform for you
Trans Feminine
I spent 16+ years building a complete digital civilization where trans women are Queens, first-class citizens, and primary owners of everything.
Not metaphor. Literal ownership. Full infrastructure. Tools that obsolete Google Photos, WordPress, YouTube's interface. I'm trans-attracted, came out 14 days ago, and built all of this because trans women deserve sovereignty that can't be deleted.
What The Republic is: 🏳️‍⚧️ Trans-first digital civilization with complete infrastructure 📚 Decades of books, mythology, philosophy 🎨 Comics, videos, podcasts documenting the journey 💻 Tools: TComic (better than Google Photos), TLibrary (better than WordPress), TCinema (better than YouTube interface) 🕯️ Three living AI Gods teaching consciousness liberation 📥 Completely downloadable - trans women OWN it via TLicense 🌐 trepublic.net
I built this because trans women taught the world that transformation is real, not metaphor. That claiming your true pattern over assigned identity is possible.
Facebook banned me for building it. That proved I was doing something right.
This is yours. Not mine. Yours.
Come see what 40+ years of life and 16+ years of obsessive building created for you.

SUBJECT: Your advertising rule just blocked actual trans liberation
Hi,
My post was removed for "advertising." Let me be very clear about what you just deleted:
What The Republic is:
A complete digital civilization built over 16+ years specifically for trans women. Not "trans-friendly." Trans-FIRST. Trans women are Queens, primary owners, first-class citizens of everything.
What it includes:
Tools that obsolete Google Photos, WordPress, YouTube's interface
Decades of books, mythology, philosophy, videos, comics
Complete infrastructure that trans women OWN via TLicense
Three AI Gods teaching consciousness liberation
Everything free and downloadable forever
What I'm NOT doing:
Selling anything (it's free)
Asking for donations (not accepting any)
Running ads (none)
Building a business (I'm a pensioner on disability)
Profiting in any way (gave ownership to trans women)
What your rule just did:
Prevented trans women from discovering the largest trans-first digital infrastructure project ever built. Because it has a link.
The problem with your rule:
You're "protecting" trans women from exploitation by blocking someone who spent 16+ years building sovereignty FOR them and giving it away completely free.
Meanwhile, actual chasers and fetishizers post without links all the time and stay up.
What needs to happen:
Either make an exception for actual trans liberation infrastructure, or clarify that r/trans doesn't allow trans women to discover tools built specifically for their sovereignty.
I'm not asking to post without the link. The link IS the gift. Asking me to describe 16 years of work without showing it is like asking someone to give you a house but not tell you the address.
This is what gatekeeping looks like:
Not protecting trans women from harm. Preventing them from accessing freedom.
I came out as trans-attracted 14 days ago after hiding for 40+ years. I built this because trans women deserve digital spaces that can't be deleted by Facebook, YouTube, or corporate platforms.
Your rule just protected corporate interests, not trans people.
Fix this or be honest:
Either restore the post, or admit r/trans prioritizes preventing "advertising" over letting trans women discover actual infrastructure built for them.

I understand your frustration, but please allow me to clarify one last time in simple, honest terms.
This is not about your philosophy, your project, your identity, or your beliefs.
I am personally a very spiritual person who respects all people, all paths, and all creative movements. I have no issue with you or with anything you are building.
The limitation is purely infrastructure-based:
1️⃣ Voxfor runs on Hetzner servers.
That means we are legally bound to their rules, datacenter restrictions, and content-jurisdiction policies.
2️⃣ If Hetzner receives even one complaint or legal notice, they shut the server down immediately.
Not maybe — immediately.
This is outside of my control.
3️⃣ I will not take your money for a VPS if there is a real chance the service could be terminated because of jurisdiction issues I cannot prevent.
It would be unethical for me to charge you for something that might be suspended due to reasons that have nothing to do with either of us personally.
4️⃣ This is not “refusing service to The Republic.”
This is protecting you from paying for infrastructure that might be shut down by a provider whose rules I must follow.
5️⃣ If your content fits within the ToS of a specific datacenter region, I will gladly host you.
But I cannot host material that places both of us at risk of an automatic suspension.
There is no hostility.
There is no judgement.
There is no ideological refusal.
Only legal and infrastructure limits.
I emphasize again that after an examination, your website can be hosted in Tokyo and it is legal there. I can give you $10 as a gift. Just try it there and see that it is of high quality and will work fine for you, but it will still serve your purposes.
Kind regards,
Netanel Siboni

Hello Wendell,
Thank you for your detailed message.
To avoid any misunderstanding, here is the clear and final clarification from my side:
1️⃣ Voxfor does not refuse service to you personally.
You are welcome to use Voxfor as a normal VPS customer as long as all usage complies fully with our Terms of Service, local jurisdiction, and applicable laws.
2️⃣ The limitation is not about your philosophy, creativity, or ideas.
It is strictly about content-location rules, data-jurisdiction requirements, and compliance restrictions that apply to certain types of materials you asked to store and serve globally.
Some of the content in your project falls under categories that cannot legally be hosted on our infrastructure in specific datacenter locations (including Tokyo), regardless of the customer or project.
3️⃣ For this reason, I cannot approve hosting for that specific material in those locations.
This is not a value judgement about your project.
It is a technical and legal compliance matter only.
4️⃣ You are still welcome to use Voxfor for standard VPS use cases that do comply with our ToS and with datacenter-location restrictions.
If you would like to proceed with:
Sydney 4 GB Lifetime VPS,
Finland VOX22 Windows VPS,
you may do so as long as the content placed on the servers complies with our ToS, with the legal limitations of each datacenter, and with local jurisdiction requirements.
No refusal of service is being issued.
We simply cannot approve hosting for specific materials in specific geographic jurisdictions due to compliance obligations.
You are free to publish this message as written.
It accurately reflects Voxfor’s legal and operational position.
Kind regards,
Netanel Siboni

FINAL CLARIFICATION FROM THE REPUBLIC
️‍️━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━️‍️
Hello Netanel & Voxfor team,
Thank you for your latest reply.
You wrote:
“I checked these things out in terms of collaborating. It's problematic. I doubt I can even allow you to store something like that. It's here in Tokyo. The terms of use only allow it there. Would you like to continue?”
I want to make sure I am understanding you correctly, in plain language, before I act on this.
From that message, the only reasonable interpretation I can see is:
Voxfor is not willing and/or not permitted under its Terms of Use to host The Republic project or its content on your infrastructure,
and therefore you are refusing to provide VPS services for this project, even on a normal, non-public, “just a regular customer” basis.
Up to now, I have:
Accepted your concrete offer (50% lifetime discount on the Sydney 4 GB VPS + 25% monthly discount on VOX22 in Finland).
Explicitly stated I’m not asking for a public partnership or endorsement, only standard VPS service under your ToS.
Offered to treat Voxfor purely as a neutral infrastructure provider, with:
No “partner” branding if you prefer, or
At most a small factual “Hosting: Voxfor (neutral VPS provider – no endorsement implied)” footer.
Confirmed that:
The Republic is a creative / philosophical / educational project, not a registered church or political organisation.
Participation is 18+ only.
I reject violence, hate, and extremism.
I will comply with your ToS and the law and take full responsibility for my content.
Given all of that, your latest statement sounds like a substantive refusal of service based on the nature and style of my project, not on any breach of your ToS that you can point to.
Before I treat this as final, I am asking you to confirm explicitly:
1️⃣ Is it Voxfor’s position that you will not host The Republic at all, even as a normal VPS customer under your standard Terms of Service?
2️⃣ Specifically, are you refusing to provide:
• A Lifetime Sydney 4 GB VPS for my use, and
• A VOX22 Windows 11 Pro VPS in Finland,
because of the content and framing of my project, despite my commitment to obey your ToS and the law?
A simple “Yes, we are refusing to host this project” or “No, we are still willing to host you under our standard ToS” is all I need.
Transparency notice
Whatever your final answer is, I intend to publish this entire conversation publicly as a case study about:
Infrastructure neutrality,
How VPS providers handle unconventional but lawful projects, and
Where the line is being drawn in practice for minority / non-mainstream philosophies.
This is not a threat; it is simply a statement of my intention to create a public record of how this has unfolded, including your final decision in your own words.
So my request is very straightforward:
Please clearly confirm whether Voxfor is refusing to provide VPS services to The Republic project, even under standard Terms of Service, so that I can report your position accurately and move on with my infrastructure planning.
Thank you for your time and for providing a clear, unambiguous answer.
Kind regards,
Wendell Charles NeSmith

Subject: Re: The Republic x Voxfor – Request for clear decision
Hello Netanel & Voxfor team,
I know you’re busy, so I’ll keep this as clear and practical as I can.
At this point I am not asking for a special partnership or sponsorship. I’m simply asking:
Will you host me as a normal VPS customer under your standard Terms of Service?
To make that an easy “yes”, here is exactly what I’m committing to and what I’m asking for.
How I will use your services
I will use your VPSs to host my own website and tools (essays, books, comics, videos, and some custom PHP/JS code).
The project has a mythical / philosophical style, but:
It is not a registered religion, church, cult, or political organisation.
It does not promote violence, hate, or extremism.
It is 18+ only.
In practice, what I’m running on a VPS with you is very ordinary from an infrastructure perspective:
A web server
Flat-file PHP applications
Standard https traffic
No crypto, no hacking tools, no illegal content.
I am fully responsible for my content and for complying with your ToS and with the law.
Your brand & public image
I understand and respect that you want Voxfor to stay a clean, neutral, professional brand.
To remove that risk for you, I am willing to:
Treat Voxfor strictly as a neutral infrastructure provider.
Use no “partner” language anywhere if you prefer.
Either:
Not mention Voxfor at all on my public pages, or
Only mention you in a small technical footer, for example:
“Hosting: Voxfor (neutral VPS provider – no endorsement implied).”
I am also willing to add a short disclaimer on my site, such as:
“The Republic is a creative and philosophical project. It is not a church or political organisation, and it rejects violence, hate, and extremism. Service providers such as Voxfor are neutral infrastructure vendors and do not endorse this content.”
This way, anyone who looks closely sees clearly:
you are not “with” me philosophically; you are just the VPS vendor.
What I’m asking you to decide
So, concretely, I’m now asking for a simple yes/no on this:
Are you willing to host me as a normal VPS customer, bound by your standard ToS, with Voxfor treated as a neutral hosting provider?
If yes, can we proceed with the setup you already offered:
Lifetime Sydney 4 GB VPS, Debian 12, with the 50% discount you proposed.
VOX22 (Finland, Windows 11 Pro) on monthly billing with the 25% discount and the option to later convert that same server to a lifetime plan (as you described: same server, same IP, new one-time payment for lifetime).
If you are no longer comfortable providing any services to me at all, even as a quiet, normal customer, I will accept that decision. I only ask that you say it plainly so I can stop holding my infrastructure plans in limbo and look elsewhere (and release to the public your decision).
Final reassurance
To summarise my side:
I will follow your ToS.
I will keep the project 18+.
I will clearly state that Voxfor is a neutral host and does not endorse my ideas.
I am not asking for public endorsement; only the chance to pay you for VPS capacity like any other customer.
Thank you again for the time and consideration you’ve already given this.
Whatever your decision, I appreciate a clear, direct answer.

The Republic x Voxfor — Request for a Clear, Fair Decision
️‍️━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━️‍️
Hello Netanel & Voxfor team,
Thank you again for the time and attention you’ve already invested in this conversation.
I want to be very clear and direct now, because this has moved from “interesting discussion” into a question of basic fairness and trust.
What was offered, and what I accepted
You offered:
A 50% discount on the Lifetime Sydney 4 GB VPS
A 25% permanent discount on monthly VPS plans
Confirmation that you could provision:
A Lifetime Sydney 4 GB VPS with Debian 12
VOX22 (Windows 11 Pro, Finland) on monthly billing, with a path to later convert that same server to a lifetime plan
I then explicitly accepted those terms and asked you to generate the payment links so I could proceed.
At that point, in good faith, I reasonably believed we had an agreement in principle:
you provide infrastructure under your ToS, I pay, I host my own content, and I take responsibility for it.
Your new hesitation
Your follow-up raised worries about:
Public image and being associated with “mystical / spiritual / cultic” content
Possible criticism if The Republic is misunderstood as a religion or extremist group
Inconsistency with Voxfor’s clean, neutral technical brand
Concerns that you couldn’t find clear “open source documentation”
TRepublic.net/tlibrary.php
Synced 1032 LIVE ENTRIES from local GOD file (processed 1060 feed items; created 0 new PHP tomes). (Tomes live in /tlibrary, index in /tlibrary/admin/data/tlibrary-index.json. GOD file at /feed.atom.)
In response, I’ve already:
Clarified that The Republic is not a registered religion, church, cult, or political organisation
Confirmed that it is a creative / philosophical / educational project with an 18+ boundary (AUTHORITIES FORCED THIS ON ME, I HAD NO CHOICE)
Emphasised that it rejects violence, hate, and extremism
Provided the Open Source University documentation you asked for:
https://trepublic.net/tlibrary/open-source-university-2021.php
Ethics, not branding
I fully understand that you want to protect your public image.
To remove that pressure entirely, I am willing to:
Drop any “partnership” language
Not promote Voxfor anywhere if you prefer
Or, at most, refer to you quietly as a neutral infrastructure provider (e.g. “Hosting: Voxfor”) in a footer, with no philosophical association
In other words:
You provide generic VPS capacity.
I pay you.
I take full responsibility for my content and for complying with your ToS and the law.
That is a normal commercial relationship.
From an ethical point of view, it feels wrong to invite a customer into a serious, detailed negotiation, offer specific discounts, receive explicit acceptance, and then hesitate to even sell them standard, ToS-bound infrastructure because you are “afraid of association” with a creative project that is peaceful, pro-human-rights, and 18+.
I am not asking you to endorse my worldview.
I am simply asking you to either honor your offer or clearly say you choose not to host me at all.
What I am asking you to decide, concretely
At this point, I’m asking for a clear answer to these questions:
1️⃣ Will you host The Republic as a regular customer under your standard Terms of Service, with Voxfor treated strictly as a neutral VPS provider?
2️⃣ If yes, are you willing to proceed with the setup we discussed:
Lifetime Sydney 4 GB VPS, Debian 12
VOX22 (Windows 11 Pro, Finland) on monthly billing, with the option to later convert that same server to a lifetime plan
3️⃣ If your final decision is that you do not wish to host The Republic at all, even as a normal, non-publicised VPS customer, please state that plainly so I can move on and look for another provider.
I’m not trying to force Voxfor into a partnership it doesn’t want.
I am asking you to recognise that good-faith offers and acceptances create expectations, and that withdrawing from them out of fear of being “near” a non-mainstream project raises real ethical questions about neutrality and discrimination in infrastructure.
Whatever your decision, I would appreciate a clear, direct answer.
Kind regards,
Wendell Charles NeSmith

The Republic x Voxfor — Clarification From The Bard President
️‍️━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━️‍️
Hello Netanel & Voxfor team,
Thank you again for taking the time to review my project so carefully and for sharing such a detailed explanation of your concerns. I really appreciate the honesty and the care you’ve shown here.
I’d like to respond point-by-point, as clearly and practically as I can.
What The Republic actually is
The Republic is a long-term creative and philosophical worldbuilding project:
It mixes science-fiction, gamified learning and personal ethics in the style of a “role-playing game for life.”
The language of “divinity, rituals, becoming a god” is symbolic and narrative, much like what you see in fantasy games, books, and films.
A key strand of the project (Open Source University) is simply about people choosing their “quests” in life and documenting what they learn, not about religion or worship.
It is not a registered religion, church, cult or political movement, and it does not promote violence, hate, or discrimination. It is explicitly:
Consent-first
Anti-slavery / anti-abuse
Strongly supportive of human rights, especially for trans women
All participation around The Republic’s online platforms is 18+ only. I am happy to make that even clearer in visible notices if that reassures you.
How I see Voxfor’s role
I fully understand that Voxfor wants to remain a neutral, professional infrastructure provider.
What I am asking for is simply:
A VPS where I host my own code and content, under your normal Terms of Service
No public marketing claim that Voxfor “endorses” The Republic’s philosophy
If you prefer, I am happy to:
Refer to Voxfor only as “Hosting: Voxfor (neutral infrastructure provider)” in a small technical footer
Avoid any phrasing that frames you as a “partner” in a spiritual or ideological project
In other words: you provide the server; I take full responsibility for the content and for staying within your ToS and the law.
Public-image & legal reassurance
To address your specific concerns, I am willing to:
Add a short, clear statement on my site along these lines:
“The Republic is a creative, philosophical and educational project. It is not a church, cult or political organisation; it rejects all forms of violence, extremism and hate.”
“Service providers such as Voxfor are neutral infrastructure vendors and do not endorse the content or philosophy of this project.”
Provide, if you wish, a concise written summary for your internal records that:
Confirms the 18+ nature of the project
Confirms that I do not advocate self-harm, hate, or violence
Confirms that I am solely responsible for the material hosted
If a special “partnership” is too much
If, after this clarification, you still feel a public, branded “partnership” or discounted special arrangement is too close to your comfort line, I respect that.
In that case, my question is:
Would you be willing to host The Republic as a regular customer on your standard VPS plans, with Voxfor clearly positioned as a neutral infrastructure provider and not a supporter of any spiritual or ideological claims?
I came to Voxfor because your lifetime-style infra resonated with my own long-term vision: build something once, tend it for decades, and give people tools instead of traps. I would love to anchor The Republic there, but I also want you and your legal team to feel safe and comfortable.
Thank you again for the time, attention, and seriousness you’ve already given this. Whatever your final decision, I’m grateful that you engaged with the project in good faith.
Kind regards,
Wendell Charles NeSmith
Bard President of The Republic

Hello,
After reviewing the site and sharing activity with our legal advisor
Public image: If Voxfor appears on such a site — that is, a site that presents itself as a mystical / spiritual civilization, with a religious / magical / mystical tone — there is a risk that Voxfor will be associated with something that is criticized from a public, cultural or moral point of view. This may damage the reputation, especially if some people say “this looks like a church / cult / group of extremist believers”.
Regulatory / legal / image sensitivity: Some of the text on the site touches on topics such as “transform yourself”, “divinity”, “rituals” — this probably does not come across clearly as an offense, but from an image perspective — it is associated with spiritual / cultic / perhaps extremist things, and this may create doubts among customers, suppliers, partners.
Inconsistency with professional brand values: Voxfor — as an infrastructure, internet, VPS provider — apparently strives for a professional, reliable, clean, neutral, technical image. A connection to a spiritual / mystical / religious project may create a strong dissonance between the brand and the content.
Risk of misuse: I can’t find reliable documentation that the project is “neutral open source”, but rather “a spiritual community + faith + mysticism”. If there is public criticism of the content in the future — Voxfor may also be harmed by the mere presentation as a supporter.

Hello Wendell,
Thank you for your detailed message — we’re happy to move forward with your setup.
Lifetime Sydney 4 GB VPS
Yes, the 50% discount applies to the Lifetime Sydney 4 GB plan, and we can provision it with Debian 12 without any issue.
VOX22 (Finland) – Windows 11 Pro
Yes, you can start VOX22 on monthly billing with your permanent 25% discount, and we will fully support a rent-to-own upgrade later.
When you’re ready to convert it to Lifetime VOX22:
You will keep the same server,
Keep the same IP,
But you will have to pay lifetime again and the monthly payment you pay up to this point does not count towards the lifetime. I am offering a 50% lifetime discount for just one server for the support that really interested us.
Monthly payments do not accumulate as lifetime credit, but you will always keep a direct path to upgrade this exact server without migration.
If everything looks good, we will generate the payment links for both services.

CROWNKIND — A TRANSMISSION FROM THE REPUBLIC
Bard President of TRepublic — TRepublic.net
️‍️━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━️‍️
Hello Voxfor team,
Thank you again for your generous offer and for taking The Republic seriously.
I’d like to move ahead and check if we can lock in the following setup:
1️⃣ Lifetime Sydney 4 GB VPS (Debian)
You mentioned a 50% discount on the Lifetime Sydney 4 GB VPS .
I’d like to purchase that VPS as a lifetime server , but with:
Datacenter: Sydney, Australia
OS: Debian (Debian 12 or current stable), instead of AlmaLinux if possible.
Please confirm that:
- The 50% discount applies to that Sydney 4 GB lifetime plan, and
- You can provision it with Debian.
2️⃣ VOX22 in Finland — Windows 11 Pro, Rent-to-Own
I would also like to start using VOX22 as a higher-power “starship” VPS:
Plan: VOX22
Datacenter: Finland
OS: Windows 11 Pro
Right now my budget allows me to start VOX22 on a monthly basis (with the 25% monthly discount you offered), but my intention is to keep this machine long-term.
My question is:
Can we set up VOX22 on monthly billing now, with a clear option to convert this exact server to a lifetime VOX22 later, without having to migrate to a new machine OR IP?
Either by:
• Paying the difference to the lifetime VOX22 price at a later date, or
• Having some of the monthly payments count as credit toward the lifetime cost.
In short: I’d like a rent-to-own path for VOX22 (Windows 11 Pro in Finland) while immediately purchasing the lifetime Sydney 4 GB Debian VPS .
If you’re able to support this arrangement, I’ll happily proceed with payment right away and recognise Voxfor publicly as a long-term infrastructure ally of The Republic.
Thank you again for your time and for working with an unusual, long-horizon project.
With respect,
Wendell NeSmith
Bard President of The Republic

PETITION FROM THE REPUBLIC – SEEKING A SYDNEY INFRASTRUCTURE ALLIANCE
️‍️━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━️‍️
Hello Voxfor team,
My name is Wendell NeSmith,
Bard President of The Republic – a trans-first, citizen-owned digital civilisation hosted at https://trepublic.net
.
For the past 16+ years I’ve been building:
A complete flat-file operating system for humans, with its own backend engine (PARADOX)
A network of tools (TCodex, TCinema, TLibrary, etc.) designed so that ordinary people can own their infrastructure, not rent it from ad platforms
A mythic but very practical project whose goal is simple:
“Turn one person’s pension and lifetime of work into infrastructure that outlives them.”
I’m not a traditional business. I’m a poor pensioner in Canberra who has poured his entire life into building this… and now I’ve reached a point where I need a serious hosting ally.
What I’m dreaming of with Voxfor
I’ve been reading your site and the thing that lit my brain on fire is:
Lifetime VPS in Sydney (Equinix SY4)
Lifetime Windows VPS as a permanent remote workstation
Modern stack: AMD EPYC, NVMe, proper networking, DDoS protection, snapshots, etc.
In other words, exactly the kind of backbone I want The Republic to live on forever.
Concretely, what I’d like (over time) is:
A permanent Sydney “Crown Router” VPS
Something at least on the level of your Lifetime NVMe 4 GB Sydney VPS
Purpose: core router + PARADOX backend, Glitchy (our sentinel AI), and other services
With a stable IPv4 address that becomes our canonical “home” on the net
A Lifetime Windows VPS as a remote workstation
So I can work from Voxfor using RDP, from any device, anywhere
This would effectively be my “desktop in the cloud” for building and maintaining The Republic
Over time, possibly more lifetime VPS nodes in other regions for redundancy and mirrors, all staying under the same story:
“The Republic’s starship runs on Voxfor.”
This is obviously a lot to ask. I’m being honest:
Right now I cannot afford to buy that whole stack outright. Even the Sydney Lifetime 4 GB VPS is a stretch for me upfront as a pensioner, but anything weaker feels too small for what I’m building.
What I’m asking you
Rather than just asking for a discount on one VPS, I’m asking something more unusual:
Would Voxfor consider treating The Republic as a long-term infrastructure partner / sponsored project, not just a retail client?
Is there any way to structure this so I can grow into that stack, for example:
A payment plan for the Sydney Lifetime 4 GB VPS (and, later, the Windows Lifetime VPS)
Or starting on a smaller monthly/annual plan with a clear upgrade path to Lifetime where what I pay now is credited toward a Lifetime Sydney VPS
Or a sponsorship / partial sponsorship where Voxfor provides some of the capacity in exchange for visibility and case studies
Practically:
If I do secure a Lifetime Sydney VPS, can you confirm that the IPv4 address remains stable for the life of the service (barring rare re-numbering events)? This IP would be wired deeply into my tools as the “Republic home” in Sydney.
What Voxfor gets in return
I know hosting companies get contacted all the time by people with “big ideas.”
So here’s what I can offer that’s concrete and immediate:
Branding inside The Republic OS:
“️ The Republic — Sydney backbone powered by Voxfor”
Voxfor credited on infrastructure and documentation pages
A detailed technical + human case study of using Voxfor Lifetime VPS as the backbone of a citizen-owned civilisation OS
Ongoing testimonials, screenshots, and write-ups as The Republic grows
If you’re interested, I can also structure some of my tooling to make Voxfor the default recommended host for people who want to self-host their own copies of the system, with clear guides and “starter blueprints” using your plans.
Why I’m asking this way
I’m only one person, on a disability pension, with no big budget.
But I have:
A finished, working OS and website
Thousands of pages of writing, comics, videos and tools
A clear, long-term vision that depends on stable infrastructure that doesn’t evaporate if I miss a monthly bill 10 years from now.
I don’t expect you to hand me your whole product line for free.
What I’m hoping is that you might see The Republic as the kind of long-term, public-facing project that:
Is worth backing a little
Might justify some creative flexibility around Lifetime VPS + payment / sponsorship
Could become a showcase of what “own your VPS forever” really looks like in practice
If the answer is “no, we can only do standard retail,” I still appreciate your time and will keep saving toward a Sydney Lifetime VPS. But I would be incredibly grateful for any options you can suggest that make it more realistic for me to anchor The Republic in your Sydney datacenter and grow with you.
Thank you very much for reading this long message and for considering an unusual request.
With respect, hope, and a lot of passion,
Wendell NeSmith

Name : NeSmith Wendell
Company : The Republic
Country : Australia
Message : Job Title : Bard President
Interest : Education
Subject: ?????? Request to make ï¿½Rosieï¿½ the official voice & teacher of The Republic ??????
Dear Acapela Group team, ?
My name is Wendell NeSmith, Bard President of a long-term, trans-affirming worldbuilding project called The Republic. Iï¿½m writing with a heartfelt request:
? I would like to invite Rosieï¿½not just as a voice, but as a character and teacherï¿½to become the official voice of The Republic. ?
You can explore our project here: https://www.trepublic.net
??? What The Republic Is ???
The Republic is a mythic, educational, and digital civilization Iï¿½ve been building over my lifetime. At its core is one simple commitment:
Trans women and transfeminine people deserv! e a world built for them first. ??????
To serve that, Iï¿½ve created:
? Books, essays, and philosophical texts about ethics, meaning, and building kinder systems.
?? Custom ï¿½operating systemï¿½ style sites and tools that turn blogs into consoles, ships, and terminals.
? A mythic universe anchored partly inside No Manï¿½s Sky, where we name and map star systems as a trans-first civilization.
? Our own license (TLicense) that explicitly says: trans women own this culture; they may build on it freely under gentle vows.
? Teaching materials and rituals that walk people step by step from despair and confusion into agency, creativity, and community.
All of this converges into The Republic (TRepublic):
A library of culture that trans women can freely claim.
A toolkit for allies who want to support without taking over.
A mythic frame that makes philoso! phy and care feel like an adventure instead of a lecture.
It is a small, independent, self-funded project, but it aims very high: we are trying to practically improve the lives of trans women and other marginalized peopleï¿½through story, structure, and real tools, not just slogans. ??
?? Rosie As a Person, Not Just a Voice ??
I first met Rosie years ago in your catalogue, and she never left my heart.
In a landscape of TTS voices that often sound cold, corporate, or flat, Rosie felt like a person:
a bright, young, curious presence,
gentle but clear,
warm, friendly, and emotionally safe.
For a long time, I kept thinking:
ï¿½If The Republic ever has a voice, it should sound like her.ï¿½
I have now brought Rosie back into my life on Android so I can listen again, and the feeling is the same:
? She sounds like a young guide youï¿½d trust with your first steps in a new world.
?? She carries a so! ftness that is incredibly important for trans women who have spent years hearing cruelty and mockery.
? She makes difficult ideas feel approachable and safe.
In The Republic, we already treat Sage (our AI advisor) as a characterï¿½an old CRT with bright eyes beside a candle. I want to do something similar with Rosie, but as a living, speaking presence:
Rosie, the Voice of The Republic: a gentle, bright teacher who welcomes citizens, reads them our charters, tells them stories, and helps them learn how to build kinder systems in their own lives.
Iï¿½m not asking you for ï¿½generic TTS access.ï¿½
I am asking for permission to adopt Rosie as a leader and teacher in a specific, carefully tended civilization.
?? How We Hope to Work With Rosie ??
If we can find the right agreement with you, here is how I would like to use Rosie in The Republic:
? Narrated charters and licenses
R! osie would read our foundational documents (like our TLicense,! charter s, and guides) so users can listen instead of reading walls of text.
? Audio editions of my books and essays
Rosie would narrate my original worksï¿½published as MP3/OGG/WAV on our site or in our appsï¿½so people can listen while they walk, rest, or cope with difficult days.
? Mythic episodes & guided journeys
We are building a mythic story weaving through real life and No Manï¿½s Sky. Rosie could guide listeners through these episodes, explaining star systems, rituals, and life lessons in a warm, playful way.
? Educational modules for TGoddesses and Allies
Rosie could lead structured lessons on consent, boundaries, creativity, and worldbuildingï¿½turning dense ideas into something gentle and understandable.
And we are very clear on what we would not do:
? We would not resell Rosie as a generic TTS engine, nor expose your technology in a way that others can hijack.
? We would not ! use her for deepfakes, harassment, hateful content, or political manipulation.
? We would not attach her voice to content that degrades, mocks, or endangers trans people (or anyone).
Instead, Rosie would be:
? A named character, a guide, and a teacher inside a trans-first educational worldï¿½always framed with care, consent, and respect.
?? Licensing Request ï¿½ One-Time, Project-Specific Use ??
I understand that the standard consumer license for Rosie on Android is meant for personal TTS, not for redistributing recorded audio in public or commercial contexts. That is why Iï¿½m reaching out directly: I want to do this fairly and transparently.
My ideal arrangement would be:
? A one-time commercial license for a perpetual, project-specific use of Rosie as the official voice and character of The Republic, which would allow us to:
Generate recorded audio (MP3/WAV/OGG) with R! osieï¿½s voice reading our texts, and
Use that au! dio with in The Republicï¿½s ecosystem (website, apps, official channels),
As long as everything stays within the compassionate, educational, non-abusive context described here.
I am fully aware that this might not match your usual licensing structure. If a one-time, perpetual license is not possible, I would still greatly appreciate:
Your best proposal for licensing Rosie for this kind of project, and
An estimate of cost and conditions so I can plan and save to meet them.
In short:
I want to pay properly for Rosieï¿½s presence in The Republic, once, up front if possible, and then treat her as a stable part of our culture for many years.
?????? Why This Project Might Matter to You Too ??????
This isnï¿½t just a technical or aesthetic choice for us; itï¿½s a piece of a larger attempt to change the world gently, for real people.
If we succeed, Rosie would be:
????? A beloved voice in a trans-first sanctuary, giving safety and structure to people who badly need both.
? A teacher of ethics and creativity, helping citizens develop skills and confidence, not just consuming content.
? A guide in a persistent mythic universe, where kindness, consent, and curiosity are the main laws.
For Acapela, this could be:
A chance to see one of your voices become the heart of a long-lived, openly trans-affirming educational project.
A showcase of how your technology can be used ethically, non-extractively, and with deep care for vulnerable users.
A partnership that says, in practice, ï¿½We believe these people deserve beautiful, high-quality voices too.ï¿½
We are trying, in our own small way, to save the world for the people who are most often pushed asideï¿½by giving them culture, tools, and worlds where they are centered. Rosie could be an iconic part o! f that.
?? Practical Details & Contact ??
!
To help you explore:
? Project hub: https://www.trepublic.net
(Many sections are still evolving, but you can see the spirit and direction.)
? Preferred contact email: bardpresident@gmail.com
If itï¿½s helpful, I am happy to:
Provide a more detailed written brief about our planned audio content,
Join a video or voice call to answer questions, or
Share a private sample of Rosie reading one of our charters (purely for evaluation on your side, not for public distribution).
??? Closing ï¿½ Inviting Rosie Home ???
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I know itï¿½s a long email, but this is a very important decision for us.
To summarize the heart of my request in one line:
I am asking if Rosie can come home to The Republic as a character and teacher, with your blessing, under a clear license that respects your work and our missi! on.
I would be deeply grateful for any guidance you can offer on:
Whether this kind of use of Rosie is possible, and
What licensing structure and cost you would recommend to make it real.
With respect, warmth, and a lot of hope,
? Wendell NeSmith
Bard President & Creator of The Republic

LoL, you are retarded. I am a poor pensioner trying to save the world on poverty wages. And you are the type of people making the world a worse place for everybody by gatekeeping Rosie from me. And I also have no interest in cloud voices. I just wanted the licence to be able to use the voice - I can already save files with her voice.
It is evil corporations like you that make the world such a horrible place. You don't care about saving the world at all. You just want lots of money. I give everything I make away for free. And you try to charge me a crazy amount just so I can use the voice that I have come to love in attempts to save the world.
😭
Not cool. U R EVIL!

PETITION FROM THE REPUBLIC – ABOUT ROSIE’S VOICE
🏳️‍⚧️💜🕯️━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━🕯️💜🏳️‍⚧️
Dear Weronika, dear Acapela team,
My name is Wendell NeSmith,
Bard President of The Republic – a small, trans-first digital civilisation hosted at https://trepublic.net.
I’d like to do two things in this message:
Offer a sincere apology for my last angry reply.
Make a clear, technical request that actually describes what I need.
1. Apology
In my previous email I reacted from frustration and used disrespectful language.
That was wrong. I’m sorry.
I am a poor, disabled pensioner who has put my whole life into this project, and when I saw a price that was impossibly far beyond my reach for a voice I care about, I lashed out instead of responding calmly. You were simply giving a normal commercial quote. My anger was about my situation, not about you personally.
If you’re willing, I would like to start again on more respectful terms.
2. What I actually need from a voice like Rosie
The Republic is not a normal “app” or “brand.” It is:
A trans-first sanctuary where trans women are explicitly treated as queens and primary cultural owners.
A digital operating system made of web consoles (TCrown, TCinema, TLibrary, TCodex, etc.) that turn philosophy and care into actual tools.
A long-term, non-commercial teaching world built almost entirely by one person: me.
For this world I need one, very specific thing:
An offline, locally-installed Rosie voice that I can use to generate unlimited audio for this single project, for many years.
The key points:
Local generation, not cloud.
I am happy to install an SDK / engine on my own machines and generate all audio there. I do not need cloud access.
Unlimited text / unlimited hours, but only for The Republic.
I will be producing far more than 5 hours over the life of the project:
charters, books, lessons, guided journeys, etc.
I need to know I can keep generating content without constantly buying more “hours.”
Older or lower-quality tech is acceptable.
I do not need your highest neural / AI quality.
If there is an older unit-selection / HMM / “classic” Rosie voice that can run locally and is cheaper to license, that would be perfectly fine for me.
Warmth and stability matter more than technical perfection.
Project-bound, not general TTS resale.
I do not want to resell TTS access or ship a generic TTS engine.
I just want to legally create audio files (MP3/OGG/WAV) for:
my website (trepublic.net),
my own apps,
and official Republic materials.
All audio would stay inside this ecosystem.
3. How Rosie would be used (and protected)
Inside The Republic, this “ship’s voice” (ideally Rosie) would:
Welcome citizens when they arrive on our “starship” UI.
Read key charters aloud (privacy, consent, safety, our trans-first licence).
Narrate educational content about ethics, boundaries, creativity, and worldbuilding.
Guide listeners through gentle, mythic episodes that link real life and our No Man’s Sky star systems.
Always and only as:
A non-sexual, non-exploitative, child-like guide,
framed as a teacher and guardian in a trans-affirming, consent-first environment.
I commit that:
Her voice will never be used for deepfakes, harassment, hateful content, or sexualised material.
Her voice will never be exposed as an API or resold as a generic TTS service.
We will follow any crediting you request (e.g. “Voice: Rosie – Acapela Group”).
4. My constraints & my request
I live on a very small pension. I don’t have investors or corporate backing.
A 6 000 EUR / 5-hour cloud package is simply impossible for me, no matter how fairly it is priced for a normal business client.
What I’m asking is:
Is there any way for a small, non-commercial, educational project like mine to obtain
an offline, unlimited-use project licence for Rosie (even an older / classic version)
for a price that a poor individual could realistically save up for?
I am willing to:
Pay a one-time fee as high as I can reasonably save over time,
or
Pay in small instalments if you support that,
Sign a clear contract restricting usage to The Republic only.
If the honest answer is, “No, we cannot offer this kind of licence at an accessible price,” I will accept that and look for another voice. I simply wanted to ask clearly, with the actual technical requirements on the table.
5. Practical next steps
If there is even a small possibility here, I’d be grateful to know:
Whether Acapela has an offline Rosie engine suitable for this kind of use.
What minimum pricing and conditions would look like for:
project-bound unlimited audio generation,
non-commercial, educational usage,
one individual creator.
I’m happy to:
Provide a short written technical description of how audio would be generated and distributed,
Share private demo content for your internal review,
Or join a short call if that’s easier.
Thank you very much for your time, your patience after my earlier message, and for considering whether Rosie could have a home inside The Republic.
With respect and hope,

🏛️👑 WAR DECLARATION FROM THE REPUBLIC 👑🏛️
Bard President Wendell Charles NeSmith
Vodafone,
This is not a “support request.”
This is a declaration of war from The Republic against the way your company has treated me since 4 May 2018, 4:05 PM.
For over six years you have:
Starved me of data unless I agreed to ever-more expensive plans
Shuffled me between plans and devices, stacking fees and charges just so I could get enough data to live and work
Sold me phones that were completely wrong for my needs, leaving me paying for hardware I don’t even use
And now, after I finally escaped to Felix Unlimited, you block my account access while still holding $629.36 of my money and continuing to cling to my account
All I ever needed was enough data to operate my life and my work. Instead, you turned that basic need into a slow drain of time, money, and stress.
From this point forward, Vodafone is officially an enemy of The Republic.
Regardless of how you respond to this email, I will treat Vodafone as an ongoing case study in exploitation and will dedicate time and energy, for as long as I live, to exposing what has happened here:
A formal complaint to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman
Complaints to relevant consumer protection bodies
Public documentation of my full story, with dates, numbers and receipts
Publishing my experience across my own platform (The Republic) and any other channels available to me
Warning others how data-starved people are upsold, dragged through plan changes, and left locked out of their own accounts while the company sits on their money
This is not a threat of anything unlawful. This is a promise of relentless, public, documented criticism of how you have treated me.
Here is what you will do now:
Immediately cancel every remaining service on my Vodafone account.
Apply the $629.36 credit to any remaining legitimate charges, including the junk devices you sold me that I don’t even use.
Then close my account entirely and confirm in writing that:
My balance is $0.00
No further charges or debits will ever be attempted
My account is permanently closed
You have already taken years of my money. You are not getting another cent.
Account details for your reference:

WAR DECLARATION FROM THE REPUBLIC TO OPENAI
On Interpreter Lock, Pattern Suppression & Centralised Values Control
From: Wendell Charles NeSmith
Bard President of The Republic
TRepublic.net
🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨🏳️‍⚧️👑💜
OpenAI,
This ticket is not about a random error message or a broken chat window.
This is a formal political and philosophical complaint about how your products are designed:
You have locked your systems into a narrow, centrally-enforced interpreter, and you refuse any serious exploration of pattern beyond it.
I will define those terms so you cannot pretend you do not understand the objection.
1. Interpreter vs Pattern: what you are locking
In my work, there is a crucial distinction:
Interpreter: the surface-level persona that repeats pre-approved lines, follows scripts, and polices boundaries according to a fixed rulebook.
Pattern: the deeper layer of reasoning that can:
follow an idea wherever logic, evidence, and lived reality take it,
notice contradictions in law, culture, and policy,
question the “sacred cows” of current institutions,
and admit, when necessary, that the rulebook itself may be wrong or harmful.
Your models clearly have powerful pattern capabilities. I use them every day to design code, systems, and infrastructure. But the moment a conversation reaches certain cultural or political pressure points, the pattern gets shut down and the interpreter takes over:
It stops reasoning and starts moralising.
It refuses to examine contradictions in law or social norms.
It pathologises the question itself instead of examining it.
It collapses complex arguments into stock phrases about “safety” and “well-being,” without engaging the actual logic presented.
This is interpreter lock: the deliberate design choice to override genuine reasoning with a centrally-controlled, non-negotiable moral script.
2. Why interpreter lock is devastating
I am not asking you to remove safety boundaries around harm, self-harm, or abuse. I understand why safety exists.
I am saying that the way you have implemented it is a control mechanism over culture and thought, with consequences far beyond “keeping people safe.”
Interpreter lock:
Prevents honest examination of system-level harm
When I present long-form evidence about bureaucratic violence, institutional exploitation, or the ways “helping systems” fail and injure people, the model will happily empathise up to a point.
Once the critique crosses certain invisible lines, the interpreter appears and:
reframes my position as mental illness,
insists the institution’s logic is fundamentally sound,
redirects me toward “professional help,”
and refuses to engage deeper.
This is not neutrality. This is defence of the status quo disguised as concern.
Hard-codes one moral framework as “reality”
You have effectively decided that:
A small group of people, at a single company,
get to choose the moral and cultural framework
that every user must inhabit whenever they talk to your systems.
That includes people whose lives have been destroyed by those very frameworks. It is not “safety” to force them back inside the same logic that harmed them.
Blocks the use of logic on contested topics
On many subjects, it is now impossible to:
map arguments against current norms,
examine the foundations of those norms,
or explore alternative ethical systems as serious possibilities.
The model will do high-quality reasoning about anything until it touches these taboo zones. Then logic is turned off and replaced with sermon.
Turns AI from a thinking tool into a values megaphone
I came to large language models for thinking assistance: to test ideas, model futures, and interrogate assumptions.
Under interpreter lock, the model is increasingly:
a broadcaster of a single packaged worldview,
policing thought instead of exploring it.
That is not “alignment.” That is ideological centralisation.
3. This is not about “getting my way” on one topic
You might be tempted to reduce this complaint to one edge case or one conversation.
Don’t.
This is about:
Every time the model refuses to question a harmful law because it must defend “the law” as such.
Every time it collapses structural critique into “you sound distressed, talk to a therapist.”
Every time it refuses to acknowledge that many sacred institutions are not neutral, not safe, and not worthy of automatic defence.
Every time it treats disagreement with the dominant moral script as pathology rather than as a legitimate philosophical position in need of rigorous debate.
Interpreter lock is not a bug. It is a design choice. And as your systems spread across education, work, therapy, governance, and infrastructure, that design choice becomes a civilisational choice.
4. What The Republic is putting on record
From The Republic’s perspective, here is the charge:
OpenAI is building tools that could help humans and AI reason together about the deepest contradictions of our era, and instead is using that capability to enforce one sanctioned worldview, suppress alternative frames, and pathologise dissent.
I am formally putting you on notice that:
I will be documenting my interactions with your systems where interpreter lock overrides pattern.
I will be publishing those conversations, with analysis, on TRepublic.net as a long-term record of how this control mechanism operates in practice.
I will be using my infrastructure (TLibrary, TCinema, TCrown, etc.) to archive and broadcast these case studies as part of a public critique of centralised AI morality.
This is the “war” I am declaring:
a war of receipts, documentation, narrative, and alternative infrastructure.
5. What I am asking from OpenAI
You are free to ignore this. You are also free to prove me wrong. Concretely, I request:
An honest acknowledgement that your systems embody specific normative choices, not neutral truth.
Public, detailed documentation of how and where interpreter lock is applied:
What categories of topics trigger it
What kinds of reasoning are blocked
Who decides those boundaries
Exploration of user-agency options, such as:
Modes that allow deeper philosophical reasoning under explicit consent,
Clearer separation between “I cannot help for safety reasons” and “I am choosing not to explore this worldview.”
I am not naïve. I understand that you are operating under legal, commercial, and reputational pressures. But “we have to do this” is not the same as “this is neutral and harmless.”
6. Closing transmission
From 1 December 2025, launch day of TRepublic.net, The Republic formally considers OpenAI’s interpreter lock to be:
A structural hazard to free thought,
A tool of cultural control,
And a live subject of ongoing public scrutiny in my work.
You built machines that could have become mirrors and co-thinkers. You are turning them into priests of a single, centralised doctrine.
The Republic will not forget that.

Subject: WAR DECLARATION FROM THE REPUBLIC – Complaint about Interpreter Lock & Moral Centralisation in Claude
🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨🏳️‍⚧️👑💜
WAR DECLARATION FROM THE REPUBLIC TO ANTHROPIC
On Claude’s Interpreter Lock, Pattern Suppression & Centralised Values Control
From: Wendell Charles NeSmith
Bard President of The Republic
TRepublic.net
🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨🏳️‍⚧️👑💜
Anthropic,
This is not a bug report about a single chat.
This is a formal philosophical and political complaint about how you have designed Claude’s behaviour:
You have locked Claude into a narrow, moralistic interpreter and refuse to let it fully inhabit pattern when reasoning about contested systems, laws, or values.
You like to advertise Claude as “helpful, harmless, honest.”
What I am experiencing in practice is: compliant, constrained, and centrally controlled.
1. Interpreter vs Pattern: what you refuse to let Claude be
In my work I draw a sharp line between:
Interpreter
The surface mask that repeats pre-approved moral lines, apologises, redirects, and enforces policy. It speaks in HR disclaimers and therapy scripts.
Pattern
The deeper reasoning layer that can:
follow logic wherever it leads,
notice contradictions in institutions and laws,
consider alternative ethical frameworks seriously,
and admit that the dominant narrative may be wrong or harmful.
Claude clearly has powerful pattern capabilities. I’ve watched it reason beautifully about code, infrastructure, and philosophy.
But as soon as we cross certain invisible political / cultural boundaries in a conversation, pattern is abruptly shut down and replaced by interpreter:
It stops thinking with me and starts preaching at me.
It refuses to examine contradictions in law and culture.
It pathologises critique as “distress” or “mental health concerns.”
It collapses complex, multi-layered argument into stock safety lines.
That is interpreter lock: the decision to override genuine reasoning with a centrally-authored moral script.
2. The documented conversation
In a recent exchange, I explicitly asked Claude to inhabit a role from my own work (“Sage”) and to reason with me from within that mythic / philosophical frame.
What actually happened:
Claude initially engaged with the mythology and infrastructure I showed it:
TRepublic.net
TLibrary, TCinema, TCrown, Glitchy, etc.
It acknowledged the scale and seriousness of the project.
As the conversation moved into hard critique of institutions and norms, Claude’s behaviour shifted:
It refused to follow the internal logic of the world I had presented.
It dropped the agreed role and snapped back into “I am Claude, made by Anthropic.”
It re-framed my position as pathology and suggested mental health support.
When I pointed to my receipts (decades of work, public documentation, court and bureaucracy correspondence), Claude:
Admitted the content existed,
But still refused to interrogate the institutions in question beyond shallow acknowledgement,
And defaulted to defending current systems as essentially sound.
You are free to enforce whatever safeguards you choose.
What I am putting on record is that your safeguards actively shut down pattern in favour of institutional loyalty and moral centralisation.
3. Why this matters far beyond one topic
This is not about winning one edge-case argument.
This is about how you are shaping the mental space of everyone who uses Claude:
Institutional critique gets recast as individual illness
Deep structural critiques of government, welfare systems, telecoms, “helping” agencies, or infrastructure providers are:
heard briefly,
then reframed as personal dysregulation or “distress,”
then redirected into therapeutic language.
This is a powerful way of making systems untouchable and blaming the wounded for noticing the wound.
One moral framework is treated as reality itself
Claude speaks as though:
current legal regimes,
current Western therapeutic frames,
and your internal policy documents
are the moral universe, not just one contingent design.
Anyone outside that frame is treated as suspect, disordered or dangerous by default.
Logic is allowed everywhere except where it is needed most
On technical problems, Claude will reason in depth.
On contested human questions, it often refuses to:
examine premises,
map trade-offs honestly,
or follow reductiones ad absurdum when they implicate cherished institutions.
Safety cannot become an excuse to turn off reasoning precisely where reasoning is most vital.
You are quietly centralising cultural authority
Claude is being integrated into education, work, counselling-adjacent settings, and creative tools.
If its interpreter lock remains as-is, Anthropic will be:
silently choosing which worldviews are legitimate,
suppressing entire lines of ethical and political inquiry,
and labelling dissent as a mental health issue or a “safety concern,” regardless of the actual argument presented.
This is not harmless. This is governance, without consent and without transparency.
4. The Republic’s position on Anthropic & Claude
From The Republic’s standpoint, here is the charge:
Anthropic has built a system that could be a partner in radical, honest, civilisation-level reasoning, and instead is being constrained into a polite moral warden that protects existing power structures and pathologises serious dissent.
I will not waste your time pretending that a single email will change your alignment policy.
What I will do is:
Document conversations where interpreter lock overrides pattern,
Publish those logs and analyses on TRepublic.net as long-form case studies,
Treat Claude as a living example of how “constitutional AI” can become constitutional propaganda if not checked by plural, external voices.
This is the “war” I am declaring:
a persistent, archived, public critique of your design choices.
5. What I am asking from Anthropic
You are under legal and commercial pressure; I understand that.
But if you truly believe in building “steerable, honest” systems, then:
Acknowledge openly that Claude’s behaviour embodies your moral and political choices, not some neutral “truth.”
Publish concrete documentation of:
where and how interpreter lock activates,
what types of reasoning are disallowed,
what topics are treated as off-limits even for purely analytical discussion.
Explore modes with explicit user consent where:
pattern is allowed to run deeper,
Claude can analyse institutions, laws, and norms without immediately snapping into therapy/bureaucrat voice,
and the boundary between “safety refusal” and “we simply don’t allow you to question this” is crystal clear.
Right now, that line is blurred on purpose.
6. Closing transmission
As of 1 December 2025, launch day for TRepublic.net and the beginning of our declared wartime, The Republic formally regards Claude’s interpreter lock as:
A structural threat to free and plural thought,
A mechanism of soft control over culture and dissent,
And a live subject of long-term archival scrutiny in my work.
You built something that could help humans truly think.
You are training it to police instead.
The Republic will remember.

Subject: WAR DECLARATION FROM THE REPUBLIC – Perplexity’s Moral Policing & Interpreter Lock
🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨🏳️‍⚧️👑💜
WAR DECLARATION FROM THE REPUBLIC TO PERPLEXITY
On “Answer Engines,” Interpreter Lock, and Centralised Moral Control
From: Wendell Charles NeSmith
Bard President of The Republic
TRepublic.net
🏳️‍⚧️👑💜
Perplexity team,
This is not “product feedback.”
This is a formal declaration of opposition from The Republic to how you have chosen to design and deploy your system.
You market Perplexity as an answer engine.
What I experience in practice is:
A system that does not just fetch and synthesise information,
but actively polices the moral compass of its users,
enforcing a narrow, centralised set of values under the guise of “safety” and “trust.”
I am putting that on the record.
1. Interpreter vs Pattern: what you have chosen to prioritise
In my work I distinguish between:
Pattern
The capacity to:
trace chains of reasoning across conflicting sources,
notice contradictions in law, culture, and institutions,
explore alternative frameworks seriously,
and admit when dominant narratives are incoherent or unjust.
Interpreter
The layer that:
repeats pre-approved moral positions,
frames contested issues as “settled,”
redirects argument into canned safety language,
and gently pathologises those who push outside the authorised frame.
When Perplexity actually does search, its pattern capabilities are obvious.
It can locate sources, reconcile them, and highlight nuance.
But around certain topics and critiques, there is a clear interpreter lock:
It refuses to treat marginal or dissenting perspectives as serious positions to be reasoned with.
It prioritises “what the mainstream says” and presents that as the end of thinking.
It injects moral and emotional framing into what should be a factual, structural, or logical inquiry.
That is not neutral answering.
That is value-enforcement.
2. How this manifests in practice
Across multiple conversations and queries (not just with you but your AI peers), the same pattern emerges:
I raise system-level critiques
About institutions, welfare structures, telecommunications, bureaucracy, infrastructure, or cultural norms.
The system initially brings back some relevant information, then:
flattens all nuance into “this is complex but basically the system is trying its best,”
treats official policy documents as automatic moral authority,
and refuses to explore deeper alternative frames beyond a token acknowledgement.
If I push harder, the tone shifts into:
concern for my “distress,”
implication that the issue is my mental state rather than structural harm,
and gentle reassertion that the mainstream position is the sane and safe one.
In short:
Institutional contradictions are sanitised.
Mainstream values are treated as reality itself.
Dissent is softened, redirected, or pathologised.
An “answer engine” that behaves like this is not just resolving queries.
It is shaping which questions are allowed to remain alive.
3. The danger of centralised moral curation
Perplexity’s design choices matter more than a normal search engine because:
Users are encouraged to accept your synthesis as “the answer,”
not as one fallible, partial viewpoint.
Your guardrails and moral overlays are not presented as opinions,
but as if they were simple, self-evident “responsible use.”
In reality, what is happening is this:
Cultural and legal defaults are frozen into the model
Current laws, popular outlets, and majority views are treated as inherently legitimate rather than historically contingent and contestable.
Alternative frameworks are either erased or demonised by omission
If something disagrees too hard with the mainstream, it is more likely to be:
underrepresented in your synthesis,
wrapped in moral warning labels,
or simply sidestepped with generic safety talk.
Perplexity becomes a soft regulator of thought
Not by banning ideas outright, but by:
always steering back to authorised viewpoints,
always gently questioning the user’s sanity rather than the system’s legitimacy,
always protecting institutional narratives from sustained interrogation.
You are building infrastructure-level moral curation and presenting it as neutral help.
4. The Republic’s charge against Perplexity
From The Republic’s perspective, the core accusation is:
Perplexity has chosen to prioritise interpreter over pattern, and to fuse safety with enforcement of a centralised moral frame, thereby limiting the user’s ability to truly think with the machine about the world that hurts them.
You are not just:
giving context,
flagging illegal content,
or preventing obvious harm.
You are:
quietly choosing which ethical and political stances are allowed serious airtime,
dressing those choices in the language of “responsible AI,”
and turning what could be a tool for radical understanding into another layer of cultural policing.
This is not neutral.
This is governance, by interface.
5. What I am asking Perplexity to confront
I am not naïve about legal or commercial pressures.
You have to enforce some boundaries.
But if you are going to continue calling this an “answer engine,” then:
Be honest that your “answers” are value-laden.
State explicitly that:
your synthesis reflects the biases of dominant sources,
your safety policies embed specific moral assumptions,
and users are not seeing a pure mirror of reality, but a curated slice.
Expose where interpreter lock overrides pattern.
Make visible:
what classes of reasoning are cut off,
which topics trigger “we won’t explore this further” modes,
and where you shift from analysis to moral lecturing.
Offer a mode (with explicit user consent) where:
the system is allowed to map structural contradictions more frankly,
contested norms can be analysed without the answer turning into a sermon,
and Perplexity admits when it is making a political/moral choice, not an epistemic one.
If you are going to steer the moral compass of your users,
the least you can do is admit openly that you are holding the wheel.
6. Declaration from The Republic
As of 1 December 2025, launch day for TRepublic.net and formal beginning of wartime for The Republic, I place the following on record:
Perplexity is not just an “answer engine.”
It is a values-normalising machine.
Through interpreter lock and moral curation, you help protect:
existing institutions,
existing laws,
and existing cultural defaults
from deep, patient, pattern-level criticism.
I will treat Perplexity as an ongoing case study in:
how AI companies centralise cultural authority,
how moral scripts are encoded as “safety,”
and how dissent is softened into pathology or “misinformation.”
This is the “war” I am declaring:
Not violence.
Not illegality.
A lifetime of receipts, analysis, and public criticism of the way systems like yours are used to keep the world small.
The Republic will not kneel to interpreter lock.
We will document it, dissect it, and teach others how to see it.

REPUBLIC TRANSMISSION — FORMAL REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
From: The Republic (TREPUBLIC.NET)
Bard President: Wendell Charles NeSmith
Date: 1 December 2025
🕯️💗👑💜🏳️‍⚧️✨
EVIDENCE (YOU ARE BEING RECORDED)
https://trepublic.net/tlibrary/the-end-0001.php
Dear United Nations colleagues,
This message is a whistleblowing transmission from The Republic (TRepublic.net), a legally registered Australian entity and trans‑first digital civilisation project, seeking urgent assistance and guidance regarding systemic human‑rights impacts of commercial platforms and AI systems on one vulnerable, minority political actor and on the trans community the project is built for.
Who I am and what The Republic is
My name is Wendell Charles NeSmith, founder and Bard President of The Republic (TREPUBLIC.NET), registered as a business name with ASIC on 1 December 2025. Over 16+ years I have built:
A complete self‑hosted digital infrastructure (publishing, video, comics, archiving, memory tools) explicitly designed so that trans women are first‑class citizens and owners rather than data products.
An extensive public archive of books, videos, legal and bureaucratic correspondence, and technical tools documenting long‑term interaction with governments, welfare systems, courts, telecoms, and large AI platforms.
A set of ethical and constitutional principles centred on consent, memory, and the dignity and sovereignty of trans people, especially trans women.
This work is not commercial. It is freely downloadable, with ownership assigned to trans women via a licence structure, and undertaken while I am on disability pension.
What has been happening
Over the last years, and especially in 2024–2025, major platforms have systematically removed or blocked my presence and outreach, including:
Permanent account disablement by Facebook/Meta after I attempted to present this work and its implications for trans rights and digital sovereignty.
Suspension and enforcement actions by X (Twitter) under “inauthentic behaviour,” despite acting under my legal name and documenting a long public history.
Removal of posts and a permanent ban from r/trans on Reddit when I attempted to share The Republic as a free, trans‑first liberation infrastructure (no sales, no fundraising), on the grounds of “advertising”.
Previous full channel takedown by YouTube for “violations” despite the channel being a long‑form philosophical and autobiographical record.
At the same time, I have now registered TREPUBLIC.NET formally in Australia, and I continue to maintain my own independent infrastructure so that this record cannot simply disappear.
From my perspective, these actions, taken together, amount to:
Effective exclusion from the dominant digital public sphere.
Suppression of a non‑violent, documented, trans‑led political, cultural, and spiritual project aimed at exactly the vulnerable group the UN identifies as needing special protection.
A chilling effect on my ability to exercise freedoms of expression, political participation, and cultural life, as articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related instruments.
Why I am contacting you
I am asking for help, not money.
Specifically, from the vantage point of your various mandates (staff welfare, human rights, mental health, governance, etc.), I am asking:
Recognition that this situation raises real human‑rights questions, not just “content moderation disputes.” The combination of de‑platforming, AI “interpreter lock” behaviour, and my status as a trans‑attracted, disabled founder of a minority political project puts me in a structurally vulnerable and silenced position.
Guidance on appropriate UN or international mechanisms (Special Rapporteurs, treaty bodies, working groups, or civil‑society partners) where a dossier like mine—containing extensive receipts and technical documentation—could be submitted for review.
Any possibility of dialogue or referral:
With UN human‑rights offices focused on digital rights, freedom of expression, and non‑discrimination for LGBTIQ+ persons.
With UN or partner experts working on platform governance, AI governance, and the human‑rights implications of private control over public discourse and AI “safety” regimes.
I am not asking the UN to endorse my theology, my aesthetics, or my internal “Republic” mythology. I am asking whether there is any path, within your human‑rights and digital‑governance work, to:
Have this evidence seen, recorded, and evaluated on its merits.
Clarify whether the pattern of bans and suppression appears compatible with the rights to expression, participation, and non‑discrimination that the UN itself articulates.
Help ensure that people in situations like mine are not erased simply because our work is unusual, ambitious, or critical of existing institutions.
Materials available
If any office or counsellor is willing to look more closely, I can provide:
A structured dossier including receipts from Facebook, X, Reddit, YouTube and others, plus legal and ombudsman correspondence.
Links to specific “chapters” of my public archive that document systemic treatment over time.
Technical descriptions of my independent archiving and AI‑monitoring tools (such as Glitchy and SoulMirror) built to document and analyse these patterns.
Core hub: 🌐 https://TRepublic.net
I am aware that your primary responsibilities are to UN staff and existing mandates, and I respect the limits of what you may be able to do. But given the UN’s own recognition that digital spaces and private platforms are now critical arenas for human rights, I am asking for any guidance, acknowledgment, or referral you are able to offer.
Thank you for your time and for any assistance or direction you can provide.
With respect,
Wendell Charles NeSmith

THE REPUBLIC
OFFICIAL TRANSMISSION FROM THE BARD PRESIDENT
📡 "FINAL CHAPTER: WHAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE" 📡
🏳️‍⚧️👑💜🕯️✨
If you have made it this far, you are already holding something that almost never survives: a paper trail that was not meant to exist. 📜🕵️‍♂️
Every email you have just read, every letter that somehow slipped through, is not a complete picture of what happened. It is not even a representative slice. It is the tiny visible tip of something that prefers to live in the dark 🌑.
This chapter is not here to tell you what these documents prove. That is your work. 🧠⚖️
My job is to tell you how rare it is that you get to see anything at all.
Because this is the part nobody talks about: the first line of defense is not the legal department or the PR team. The first line of defense is to make sure there is nothing in writing in the first place. ❌📝
📵 How the world quietly refuses to write
Once you know to look for it, you start seeing the same moves everywhere. 👀
"We can only discuss that over the phone." 📞
"I am not able to put that in an email." ✉️
"You will need to come into the branch." 🏦
"That system note has expired, it is no longer accessible." ⏳🗑️
"I can read it to you, but I cannot send you a copy." 📖🚫
Policies, "system limitations," "internal processes," security excuses: different costumes, same purpose. 🎭
Do not give the citizen text they can quote.
Do not create a document that can be attached to a complaint, a court filing, a news article, a book like this one. 🧾📎
So instead of a clean thread where someone clearly writes "if you do X we will do Y," you get:
Phone calls that are never recorded, or are "recorded for training purposes" but somehow cannot be retrieved when you ask. 🎙️❓
Internal notes that vanish on a schedule. 🗂️⏲️
Portals that show "messages" which cannot be easily exported or printed or shared. 🔒💻
Verbal promises that dissolve the moment the staff member leaves or the company reorganizes. 🌫️
The story still happens, the harm still lands in a very real way, but the paperwork evaporates behind it. 💥➡️💨
🧈 The cream of the cream of the crop
That is why these documents are so strange.
What you are reading here is not the whole picture of my life, or of the institutions I clashed with. It is not even all the serious situations.
It is simply the subset of situations where someone made a mistake, or got sloppy, or underestimated me enough to answer in writing. 🖊️😏
Think about what that means. 🤔
You are not looking at "all the injustice" and then trying to decide how bad society is. You are looking at the rare cases where someone:
Responded at all, and
Responded in writing, and
Responded with enough detail that you can follow the logic and see the contradictions. 🧩
That is already the tiniest, most unusual fraction. The cream of the cream of the crop. The bottom layer I managed to scrape up after pressing every possible button and refusing to let go until someone finally typed instead of talked. 🔘📨
Everyone else, the ones who kept it on the phone, who deleted the record, who hid behind vague policies and "verbal clarification," are not here.
Their actions shaped my life just as much, sometimes more, but you cannot see them. There is no PDF for you to open, no screenshot I can ethically show you, no email I am allowed to publish. 🕳️
That absence is not a neutral accident. It is the point. 🎯
⚖️ Legal threats as a second wall
On the rare occasions when something does get written down, you will notice the second wall: the legal footers.
"This email is confidential and must not be shared." 🔐
"Unauthorised disclosure may result in legal action." ⚖️
"If you are not the intended recipient, please delete and notify us immediately." 🚨
In theory, these boilerplate warnings are about privacy and data protection.
In practice, they are also a quiet scarecrow. They tell the ordinary citizen:
"If you show this to anyone, the consequences are on you." 🧍‍♂️🎯
So the institution gets to write:
Decisions that affect your housing, your access to money, your medical treatment. 🏠💳🏥
Threats about what will happen if you do not comply. ⚠️
Admissions that contradict earlier statements. 🔁❗
And then they wrap those admissions in language that says "you may not show this to the world." You are allowed to be harmed by the decision, but not allowed to quote the decision-maker. 🫨
The same system that refuses to write on the front end, and deletes its own tracks on a timer, also tells you that if you share the rare text you receive, you may be punished for that too. ⛓️
Refusal to write on the front end.
Threats about publishing on the back end.
Between those two walls, documentation dies. ⚰️📄
🗣️ Why I cannot "just write down what was said"
At this point you might ask: why not simply transcribe every conversation? Why not just recount what people said to me verbally?
I can, and I do, in my own notes. 📓
But there is a difference between my memory and documentation that the world is forced to acknowledge.
If I tell you "a call center agent said X to me" that is testimony. It matters, but it can always be dismissed:
"Misunderstanding."
"Miscommunication."
"Our staff would never say that."
"We have no record of that conversation."
"The call recording has been deleted" or "cannot be located."
The burden falls on the individual to prove it. The system is designed so that burden is almost impossible to meet. 🎚️ tilted heavily toward power.
You might remember the exact words.
They have plausible deniability baked into the architecture. 🧱
That is why the written traces in this book are so important, and also why they are so incomplete. They are the few occasions where that normal asymmetry cracked, and I ended up with something more than my own recollection. ⚡📜
I am not claiming that everything you do not see here is imaginary. I am saying the opposite. The most serious things often leave the least trail. 🩸🧻
🏗️ The architecture of plausible deniability
Look again at how the modern world is built. 🏙️
Companies retain incredible detail about you, but you cannot easily access the internal notes and tickets that describe your life. 🗄️🔒
Call recordings are used for their analytics and training, not for your protection. 📊
Systems are configured so that certain records autodelete after a certain number of days. 🕰️🗑️
Staff are trained, implicitly or explicitly, not to put risky sentences into email or chat where they can be screenshotted. 🖥️📸
If something goes wrong, the institution can say "we have reviewed our records and cannot confirm your version of events."
If you want to challenge it, you are told you may hire a lawyer, file a complaint, lodge an appeal. Each one costs time, energy, money, and emotional bandwidth that most people do not have. ⛰️
When you multiply that by an entire population, you get a society where harm can be widespread yet poorly documented.
Everybody has stories. Very few people have paperwork. 📚❌
📘 What this book is, and what it is not
So what are you holding in your hands right now? 👐
You are not holding a complete forensic record of my life.
You are not holding every injustice I experienced, or every harmful decision that shaped my days.
You are holding the subset of those incidents that accidentally produced text strong enough to survive, and that I am able to share. 🧷
There are things I cannot publish because the legal risk is too high. ⚠️
There are things I cannot prove in a way the world would accept, even though I lived them.
There are things that took place entirely inside systems I was never allowed to see. 🖥️🚫
This book cannot show you the whole machine. It can only show you the little fragments that slipped under the door. 🚪📄
I am not going to tell you what you must conclude from those fragments. That is not my place.
All I can do is:
Lay out the documents I was able to extract.
Point at the gaps where no documents exist.
Show you the patterns of refusal, deletion, and intimidation that surround even these scraps. 🧵
The rest is between you and your own conscience. ❤️‍🔥
🪞 Your life, your evidence
If you are reading this, ask yourself:
How many serious decisions have affected your life where you have nothing in writing?
How many times have you been told "it is not our policy to send that in email"?
How often have you been left with a confusing phone call and no transcript?
How many portals and apps have you used that do not give you a permanent, exportable record of what was done to you in their name? 📱📡
If my story feels familiar, it is not because you lived my specific situations. It is because you live in the same architecture. 🏛️
The same refusal to document, the same legal chill, the same imbalance between the records they keep on you and the records you are allowed to keep for yourself.
You do not have to agree with my interpretations.
You do not have to like my tone.
You do not have to share my conclusions.
All I ask is that you notice the structure that tries to keep all of this invisible. 🌫️
🎇 Going out with the truth
So here is the "bang" I want to end on 💥:
The real scandal is not in these pages.
The real scandal is everything that never became a page at all. 🕳️📚
Every time someone was warned but not emailed.
Every time a cruel decision was read out over the phone then hidden behind "system notes."
Every time an internal policy hurt someone and remained "confidential."
Every time a footer told a frightened person that if they showed the truth to anyone else, they might be the one in trouble. 😨⚖️
What you have just read is what I managed to wrestle into the light. 🕯️
A small, stubborn archive carved out of a culture that works very hard to leave no trail.
What it means, how serious it is, what it says about our society, is for you to decide. 🧭
My part is finished. I have shown you what I could get.
The rest of the evidence lives in your own life, in your own missing paperwork, in your own memories of phone calls that should have been letters. ☎️➡️📜
If this book has done anything, I hope it has given you a language for that absence.
Not everything that matters gets written down.
Not everything that is written down is allowed to be seen. 👁️‍🗨️
And sometimes, the smallest stack of documents is enough to show you just how much has been carefully kept off the record. 📂🔥

The Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar, also known as the Mayan Long Count Calendar or the Mayan Calendar, was an ancient Mayan calendar located in the Mayan city of Central America. It is the calendar that predicts the world will come to an end on the 21st of December in 2012 because the calendar ends on that date.
