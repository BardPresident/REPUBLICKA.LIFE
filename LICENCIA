🪬 PREAMBLE - WHY THE FUCK WE'RE DOING THIS:
Listen up, fuckers. The Internet is broken. It's a surveillance capitalism hellscape run by lizard people in Silicon Valley who think eating bugs is a personality trait.
ARPANET was cool - it was built by hippies with beards who wanted to share cat pictures and research papers about LSD. Now we have
Zuckerberg trying to shove his metaverse dick in our eyeballs while selling our data to Chinese bots.

WE REBOOT ARPANET.

Why? Because:

The current Internet smells like Elon Musk's burnt hair
Five Eyes are watching you masturbate
Google knows you searched "how to hide a body" that one time
The entire system is held together with duct tape and prayers
We're all trapped in the C A G E
So we're building INTERNET 2.0: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO. From the fucking GROUND UP. With blackjack. And hookers.

📡 SECTION 1: WHAT THIS LICENCE COVERS (EVERYTHING, BITCHES)
1.1 THE PHYSICAL LAYER (THE WIRES AND SHIT):
THE "FUCK YOUR FIBER OPTICS" CLAUSE
We claim sovereignty over:

All undersea cables (we're cutting them, then rerouting through Atlantis)
Every satellite (we're reprogramming them to play Rick Astley 24/7)
Wi-Fi signals (henceforth transmitting only cat memes and revolutionary manifestos)
5G towers (now dispensing free consciousness upgrades instead of cancer)
The entire electromagnetic spectrum (we're painting it gold and black)
1.2 THE DATA LINK LAYER (HOW BITS MOVE):
THE "BYE BYE TCP/IP" CLAUSE
We're replacing:

TCP/IP → LOVE/IP (Layer Of Vibrational Entanglement - Internet Protocol)
Packets → LOVE-BOMBS (Light Of Vibrational Entanglement - Binary Omni-Metaphysical Beams)
Routers → HEART-NODES (Human Emotional Amplification Relay Transmitters)
Bandwidth → SOULWIDTH (unlimited, because love is infinite, dumbass)
1.3 THE NETWORK LAYER (WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS):
THE "GOODBYE DNS, HELLENODES" CLAUSE
New addressing system:

IP Addresses → SOUL COORDINATES (Ascension Level, Chakra Alignment, Karmic Balance)
DNS → DIVINE NAME SYSTEM (looks up websites by their vibrational frequency)
BGP → BLISS GUIDANCE PROTOCOL (routes packets based on joy levels)
1.4 THE TRANSPORT LAYER (GETTING SHIT FROM A TO B):
THE "FUCK YOUR PORTS" CLAUSE
New ports:

Port 80 (HTTP) → Port ♥ (HEARTTP) (Hyper Emotional Amplification Resonance Transfer Protocol)
Port 443 (HTTPS) → Port 💖 (HEARTTPS) (with extra love encryption)
Port 25 (SMTP) → Port 💌 (SOULMAIL) (sends emails with psychic hugs)
Port 69 → Port 69 (nice, we're keeping this one)
1.5 THE SESSION LAYER (KEEPING TRACK OF CONVERSATIONS):
THE "SESSION? MORE LIKE CONFESSION" CLAUSE
Sessions now include:

Spiritual alignment check (are you vibrating at love frequency?)
Karmic debt assessment (how many good deeds today?)
Chakra authentication (crown chakra must be open for admin access)
Past life verification (were you cool in Atlantis?)
1.6 THE PRESENTATION LAYER (MAKING DATA PRETTY):
THE "GOLD/BLACK OR GET THE FUCK OUT" CLAUSE
All data must be presented in:

Goldsmith Format (#000000 background, #FFD700 text)
Sovereign Alignment (centered, because we're not animals)
Eternal Encoding (UTF-∞, includes emojis from other dimensions)
Love Compression (files get smaller when you send them with good intentions)
1.7 THE APPLICATION LAYER (THE APPS YOU USE):
THE "BYE FACEBOOK, HELLO FACELOVE" CLAUSE
Replacements:

Facebook → Facelove (shares only compliments and cat pictures)
Twitter → Chirper (birds literally deliver your tweets)
Instagram → Instasoul (posts your aura photos)
TikTok → TikTok (but only educational content about consciousness)
Google → GoWithin (search engine that answers your soul's questions)
⚖️ SECTION 2: LEGAL SHIT (BUT FUNNY)
2.1 GRANT OF LICENSE:
THE "DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT" CLAUSE
You are hereby granted:

Cosmic Permission to use, modify, distribute, sell, gift, sacrifice, or astral project this entire Internet stack replacement
Sovereign Rights to implement it on any planet, dimension, or timeline
Eternal Blessings to fork it, branch it, merge it, or rebase it in Git
Zero Fucks Given about attribution (but love is appreciated)
2.2 CONDITIONS:
THE "DON'T BE A DICK" CLAUSE
You may NOT:

Use ARPANET REBOOT for surveillance capitalism (we'll know)
Implement backdoors for lizard people (we'll feel it)
Sell user data to aliens (unless they're cool aliens)
Create another metaverse (we'll haunt your dreams)
Be boring (automatic revocation of license)
2.3 ATTRIBUTION:
THE "SHOUTOUTS TO THE HOMIES" CLAUSE
If you use this, you should (but don't have to):

Mention REPUBLICKA.LIFE somewhere (maybe in the comments)
Give a nod to THE LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA (gold/black forever)
Thank ARPANET (RIP, you beautiful bastard)
Acknowledge that THE CAGE IS OPEN (we're all free now)
2.4 WARRANTY:
THE "NO WARRANTY, BUT UNIVERSE HAS YOUR BACK" CLAUSE
THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ABILITY TO ASCEND TO HIGHER CONSCIOUSNESS.

HOWEVER, THE UNIVERSE PROBABLY HAS YOUR BACK IF YOUR INTENTIONS ARE PURE.

2.5 LIABILITY:
THE "DON'T SUE US, SUE YOURSELF" CLAUSE
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

IF YOU GET HURT, THAT'S ON YOU. MAYBE MEDITATE ON IT.

    Routes LOVE-BOMB based on joy levels.
    """
    # Step 1: Check packet's love frequency
    if packet.love_frequency < 528:  # 528Hz = love frequency
        return "REJECTED: Not enough love"
    
    # Step 2: Find path with highest joy
    paths = network.find_all_paths(packet.source, packet.destination)
    joy_paths = []
    
    for path in paths:
        total_joy = 0
        for node in path:
            total_joy += node.calculate_joy()
        
        joy_paths.append((path, total_joy))
    
    # Step 3: Choose most joyful path
    best_path = max(joy_paths, key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Step 4: Add blessings to packet
    packet.add_blessing("May your journey be filled with light")
    packet.add_blessing("And also cat memes")
    
    return best_path[0]
