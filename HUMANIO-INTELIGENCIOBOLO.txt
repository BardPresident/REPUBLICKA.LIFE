The link you posted leads to a page that claims to contain “The Living Law of Existence” by “Trepublic.”
Nothing on that site is recognized scholarship, science, or philosophy; it is an anonymous, self-published manifesto.
There is no evidence that the text is used by any university, legal body, or scientific community, and it does not appear in any reputable catalogue (WorldCat, JSTOR, HeinOnline, etc.).
In short, it is not a “signal” of anything beyond one individual’s personal cosmology.
If you are looking for rigorous treatments of “laws of existence,” you would get far more mileage out of standard works such as:
Physics and cosmology: Weinberg, Carroll, Penrose.
Philosophy of logic and metaphysics: Kripke, Lewis, van Inwagen.
Legal philosophy: Hart, Dworkin, Raz.
If you have a specific question—e.g., what the manifesto actually asserts, or how its claims compare with established science or jurisprudence—let me know and I will walk through it point by point.

I can’t process, verify, or publicize the material you pasted.
It appears to contain:
A long, unexplained list of government and NGO e-mail addresses
A private 2018 rejection letter from ASIO that was never meant for publication
A 2020 reply in which the same sender declares he is “starting to work for ASIO publicly,” followed by profanity and what looks like a threat to release attachments called “EPISTEMOLOGICKARIABOOTSNIPERAtxt”
Even if the sender chose to post this himself later, IMDb’s trivia queue is not an appropriate or secure channel for it, and repeating it here would only amplify doxxing and unverified intelligence-community claims. Nothing in the text meets any reasonable definition of verifiable, encyclopaedic trivia about Miranda Cosgrove.
If you believe you have a legitimate, well-sourced piece of trivia about Ms. Cosgrove, please write it in one or two neutral sentences and supply a published reference (article, interview, official documentary, etc.). I’ll be happy to help you word it for re-submission.

Reasoning
Based on the content of the receipt and the text you submitted, it is highly likely that this contribution will be rejected by IMDb.
Here is a breakdown of why this submission violates IMDb's guidelines:
1. Irrelevance to the Subject The submission is categorized as "Trivia" for Miranda Cosgrove, but the text contains:
A long list of email addresses (many belonging to government and educational organizations).
A forwarded email chain regarding a job application rejection from ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation) by a person named Wendell Charles NeSmith. None of this information relates to Miranda Cosgrove's career, life, or filmography.
2. Inclusion of Private Information IMDb strictly prohibits the publishing of private email addresses, private correspondence, and personal contact information in user contributions. The text you submitted contains dozens of email addresses and a private email exchange.
3. Formatting and Coherence IMDb trivia items are required to be clear, factual, and readable. The text appears to be a raw copy-paste of an email header or a "spam" list, which does not constitute a trivia fact.
What happens next? IMDb editors will review the submission. Once they determine it violates the terms regarding relevance and privacy, they will decline it. You will receive another email notification updating the status of the contribution to "Declined."
If you wish to add trivia about Miranda Cosgrove, you should submit a specific, interesting fact about her acting roles or public life that does not include third-party private data.

Reasoning
Analysis of IMDb Submission Receipt
Thank you for sharing this IMDb confirmation email. I've analyzed the content and need to provide you with important information about what appears to be a problematic submission.
Key Concerns
This submission raises several serious issues:
Inappropriate Content: The "trivia" you submitted contains what appears to be:
A massive list of email addresses from government organizations (including Iranian domains like mfagovir)
References to intelligence agencies (ASIO, CIA)
A forwarded message containing concerning claims about working for intelligence agencies
Offensive language ("NO REPLY FUCKIN IDIOTOS LUV iCharly")
Policy Violations: This submission likely violates IMDb's content policies because:
It appears to contain personal information of others without consent
Includes what seems like email harvesting attempts
Contains potentially threatening language regarding intelligence agencies
Includes inappropriate/offensive content
Security Concerns: The content referencing ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation) with statements like "I am now the public figure for ASIO" could potentially trigger security reviews.
Recommended Actions
Contact IMDb Immediately:
Use the "View Contribution Status" link in the email
Request withdrawal of this submission before it's processed
Explain it was submitted accidentally or without proper review
Security Consideration:
If you did not intentionally submit this content, your account may have been compromised
Change your IMDb and Gmail passwords immediately
Check for any other unauthorized activity
Legal Awareness:
Submitting others' contact information without consent may violate privacy laws in many jurisdictions
Content referencing intelligence agencies could attract unwanted attention from authorities
Clarifying Questions
To provide better guidance, I need to know:
Did you intentionally submit this content, or was it accidental?
Are you aware of the content you submitted, or did someone else access your account?
What was your original intention with this IMDb submission?
This appears to be either a serious mistake or potentially problematic content that should not be published. IMDb typically rejects submissions containing personal information of others, offensive content, or security-related claims like those in this submission.
Would you like guidance on how to properly contact IMDb to withdraw this submission?

It appears you received a confirmation email from IMDb regarding a contribution you made to their database. The email confirms that your submission has been received and is being processed, but it also contains a significant amount of unrelated and potentially concerning text. Let me break down the key points and address the unusual content:
Key Points from the IMDb Email:
Contribution Confirmation:
Your submission (a trivia item for Miranda Cosgrove) has been received and is being processed.
Processing times vary depending on the type of data contributed.
Next Steps:
You can view the status of your contribution or update your IMDb profile if needed.
Unusual Content in the Email:
The email includes a large block of text that appears to be unrelated to IMDb or your contribution. This text seems to be a mix of:
Email addresses, some of which are associated with government, educational, and religious organizations.
References to individuals and organizations, including political, religious, and intelligence-related entities.
A forwarded message from someone named Wendell Charles NeSmith, which includes a complaint about a job application rejection from ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation) and mentions of the CIA.
Possible Explanations for the Unusual Content:
Email Forwarding or Hacking:
It's possible that the email was forwarded or intercepted, and the additional content was appended by someone else.
Alternatively, your email account or the sender's account may have been compromised.
Mistake or Technical Glitch:
The unrelated text could have been accidentally included due to a technical error or misconfiguration in the email system.
Malicious Intent:
While less likely, the email could have been intentionally altered to include misleading or concerning information.
Recommendations:
Verify the Email:
Check the email headers to confirm the sender's identity and ensure it was sent from IMDb.
If you're unsure, contact IMDb directly to verify the legitimacy of the email.
Secure Your Account:
Change your email account password and enable two-factor authentication if you haven't already.
Scan your device for malware or suspicious activity.
Report the Issue:
If you suspect your account has been compromised, report it to your email provider and IMDb.
Ignore the Unrelated Content:
The additional text does not seem relevant to your IMDb contribution and may not require further action on your part.
Conclusion:
The IMDb confirmation email is legitimate, but the additional content is unrelated and potentially concerning. Take steps to secure your email account and verify the email's authenticity. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!

I can see this is an IMDb contribution confirmation email that appears to contain some unusual content. The main issue I notice is that the "Name Trivia" section for Miranda Cosgrove contains what appears to be a large block of copied text that doesn't belong there - it looks like a collection of email addresses and what seems to be a personal email exchange that was accidentally pasted into the submission.
The legitimate part of the email shows:
A standard IMDb contribution confirmation (#260115-103945-155000)
A submission for Miranda Cosgrove to add trivia
But the actual trivia content seems to be corrupted with unrelated text
If you intended to submit legitimate trivia about Miranda Cosgrove, this submission likely won't be processed correctly because it contains irrelevant content. The IMDb team will probably reject it due to the unrelated text.
You might want to:
Check your original submission to see what went wrong
Resubmit the trivia with only the relevant content
Remove the large block of email addresses and personal correspondence
Is there something specific about this email you'd like me to help you with?

It looks as though you have pasted the automatic confirmation e-mail that IMDb sends every time a contribution is filed. From the fragments I can see, your submission was:
• Title: Miranda Cosgrove – Name Trivia (1 item)
• Content you tried to add: a very long block that begins “NARUTO GI REPUBLICKA…” and then lists dozens of e-mail addresses plus a forwarded ASIO/CIA message.
If that was intentional:
Expect it to be rejected.
Trivia items must be short, sourced facts about the person’s life or career. Material that is off-topic, private e-mail, or unrelated contact lists will not meet IMDb’s guidelines and will almost certainly be declined during processing.
If it was NOT intentional (for example, you copied the wrong text into the form):
You cannot literally “cancel” a submission once it has been sent, but you have two options:
a. Wait. The editors will see that it does not meet policy and will simply reject it.
b. Submit a correction immediately:
• Log in to IMDb.
• Go to “Contribution History.”
• Click “Track Contribution” next to #260115-103945-155000.
• Choose “Re-open” (or “Need to update this submission?”) and replace the text with the correct trivia, or delete the item.
General tips for Name Trivia:
• Keep it concise (one or two sentences).
• Make sure it is relevant to Miranda Cosgrove’s life, career, or well-documented personal facts.
• Provide a reliable citation or source if it is not common knowledge.
• Avoid private correspondence, phone numbers, e-mail lists, rumors, or speculative statements.
If you believe your account was used without your knowledge, change your IMDb password immediately and review any other recent submissions. Otherwise, simply correct or withdraw the trivia item as outlined above and it should resolve itself.
Let me know what part of the process you’d like more help with—editing the submission, tracking its status, or anything else.

Reasoning
I can see you've posted the same IMDb confirmation email for a third time. Let me be very clear about what's happening:
This is NOT valid IMDb content. What you submitted as "trivia" for Miranda Cosgrove is actually:
A massive list of random email addresses
Personal correspondence between individuals and government agencies
Completely unrelated to Miranda Cosgrove or any entertainment content
This submission will be automatically rejected because it violates IMDb's contribution guidelines.
What likely happened:
Clipboard error - You may have accidentally copied and pasted the wrong content
Account compromise - Someone else may have accessed your account
Browser auto-fill - Your browser may have auto-filled with cached content
Immediate actions you should take:
Log into IMDb immediately
Go to your Contribution History
Find submission #260115-103945-155000
Use "Re-open" or "Edit" to withdraw this submission
Change your password if you didn't intentionally submit this
What would be appropriate Miranda Cosgrove trivia:
Her role in "iCarly" and "School of Rock"
Her musical career and albums
Her education at USC
Her voice acting work
Are you trying to:
Withdraw this submission?
Report a compromised account?
Learn how to write proper trivia?
Something else?
Please let me know what specific help you need, and I'll assist you accordingly.

Based on the receipt you have provided (Contribution #260115-103945-155000), here is an analysis of the situation and what will happen next with your IMDb submission.
Status: High Probability of Rejection
This submission will almost certainly be declined by IMDb data editors.
Reasons for Rejection:
Irrelevance: You submitted this under Name Trivia for the actress Miranda Cosgrove. The text contains a massive list of government/NGO email addresses and a personal letter regarding a job application to ASIO (Australian Security Intelligence Organisation). This has absolutely no connection to Miranda Cosgrove, her career, or her biography.
Privacy Violation: The submission contains a large number of private and organizational email addresses and names. IMDb strictly prohibits publishing private contact information in trivia sections.
Formatting and Profanity: The text is an unformatted "data dump" and ends with aggressive language ("FUCKIN IDIOTOS"), which violates IMDb's content guidelines.
"iCharly" Reference: While the signature says "LUV iCharly," (likely a reference to her show iCarly), this does not make the preceding text valid trivia.
What is actually in the text you submitted:
