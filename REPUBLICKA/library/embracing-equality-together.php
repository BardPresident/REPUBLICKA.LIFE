My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>As I immerse myself in the pages of "The Second Sex" by Simone de Beauvoir, I find myself captivated by its profound insights. It is a lengthy read, but its significance as the foundation of feminism makes every word worth it. I urge you to embark on this journey with me and delve into this masterpiece. It will broaden your horizons and equip you with the knowledge to represent your gender to its greatest potential.</div><div><br></div><div>It is our shared duty, my love, to lift women up and provide them with all they need to flourish. To represent their gender effectively, one must understand the struggles they have faced in their quest for equality with men. Women are half of the equation of our species and deserve the right to rule this planet equally alongside men. Together, let's embody the best that humanity has to offer.</div><div><br></div><div>As a couple, we must fight for equality and stand on equal grounds. Be my equal, my love, and create romantic videos for me just as I do for you. I am giving you everything I desire from you, and in return, let's make history as the greatest couple ever to exist. Let our love be a beacon of hope and equality, inspiring others to fight for a better world.</div><div><br></div><div>Yours forever,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
