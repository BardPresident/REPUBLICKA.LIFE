We do not act "rightly" because we are "excellent", in fact we achieve "excellence" by acting "rightly".</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>The Game</p><p>March 26, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>What world is there before us, dear Wendy? From 1984 I was exposed to a technological world. I have spent my life attempting to make my work a technological world. I always loved the ideas of games since my childhood. But what if we could make real life into a digital game? My favourite genre of games are role-playing games where you do missions to level up your character. What if we could make a role-playing game where these online missions were real and performed a social duty. If I could only help people from the comfort of my own home through the Internet then I could be very useful to society. I very much love running around in RPG games performing missions to help people. If these missions were only performed in real life, then I could be very useful to society.</p><p><br /></p><p>I see a bright future for kids, my love. I see a future for kids where they can be contributing members of society. The game could start out as a free to play game and train you in all the game mechanics. After you get good enough to be useful to other real people, you could then be set off into the world as a mercenary, being hired by real people to perform real jobs that need to be done. As you level up your character you get a higher wage. How well you perform your jobs and the feedback received will determine the numbers on your paycheck. As technology grows, more and more online related work is needed. Eventually, many jobs will be able to be performed through an Internet connection. A software needs to become available that gamifies employment. I need to be capable of sitting at home while helping people around the world with their problems.</p><p><br /></p><p>Every child is given a blank avatar upon their birth. The game starts recording their life from the time that they sign into the game. They can divulge as much or as little as they wish to the game, but from the moment they sign in for the first time they become employees of it. They can stop working whenever they want and they will not pay for or receive payment for any of the training missions. Once they get comfortable how the system works, they will become employable people who others can hire for jobs they wish to be performed.</p><p><br /></p><p>The game must have many types of gaming mechanics. The result of many different types of jobs will create the gaming mechanics of the system. All jobs are documented publicly so the information will be used to create new gaming mechanics that would improve efficiency merely by turning a mundane job into a video game. New games are constantly created depending on the field required. The goal of the game is to get as many jobs possible gamified into a piece of software that engages and encourages the player to succeed and progress. A LARP is a live action role playing game where one plays as their own character in real life. Why can employment not be a LARP? How are employment agencies not realising the potential of LARPing through life in a piece of software that helps nerds to be free in society?</p><p><br /></p><p>In time, my dear, a sweatshop will not be possible. A receive only android will be created that is controlled remotely with a gaming controller. Our skills can be utilised by technology learning from our every action, performed through a game-like remote. In time this remote will receive through brainwaves. This will quickly outdate old jobs as it learns from our actions. But that just gives the employee incentive to keep up with the latest developments. Promotions in level (and thus salary) are held with the highest esteem and cannot be reversed. Getting fired is very difficult and would require much evidence into why you no longer deserve to be on the platform.</p><p><br /></p><p>This book is composed of letters to and from my Wendy Lady. The structure of this book will be Wendy and I playing ping-pong with ideas together. Each chapter will be a letter in which the receiver will respond to and create new ideas. The idea is to create an evolution of thought in which a good idea can be perfected through the use of multiple brilliant individuals. The topics of discussion are not limited to what has been presented. New ideas will emerge and the ending will be completely different than the beginning. Or will it? Time will only tell the story of two lovers who are forbidden to be with each other. If you listen closely, you will be able to hear the cries of Romeo and Juliet within our story. Because even though this is a story about the evolution of society into a games-based culture, this is truly a story about two people who are forbidden to be together.</p><p><br /></p><p>Within Open Source University students will be guided to information that can assist them in acquiring skills. All teaching performed will be open source and not receive an income for. However, students will gain the abilities to perform duties on their platform and if they win over a teacher's heart, they can be recognised as a teacher of that individual. In this way, each employee is recognised by teachers and are thus, more enjoyable.</p><p><br /></p><p>Students will be encouraged to spend quality time with each other. The system in itself will encourage students to meet up and talk. Social practices are required for optimal human psychology. We need to have friends in real-life in order to develop most effectively. Thus, Open Source University will be a social platform as well, encouraging friendships amongst those who you are close with who you share qualities. The platform will record everything and recommend to you individuals who you are psychologically similar to.</p><p><br /></p><p>What am I truly proposing? A mix of right and left. Such a system would make us a meritocracy. What would the results of such a system be? I wish to see a society run by kids. I wish to see a society where the kids are the ones running the world. Adults must bow to kids and allow them to succeed in life even in their childhood. Knowledge is power and if the kids only knew what was going on then they could spend their lives to change it. The corruption of our governments have run rampant. And no one individual can ever succeed, unless they have great inheritances. We live in a world run by the dead. Both physically and spiritually.</p><p><br /></p><p>What has never been explored? The name Wendell means adventurer. But what is an adventurer without a place to adventure to? All of our earth has been discovered. There are no new lands to see. Thus, an adventurer must travel outside of their mind to create ideas instead of land. The land is already generated before us and alternative means of adventuring must be explored in order to see new things. In order for us to change as the human population, we need a new ideology before us. Exploring the digital world and its possibilities is the purpose of this book, my dear. Let's have fun writing it together.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>School of Thought</p><p>March 30, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Dearest Wendell, I whole heartedly agree. What a wonderful world we could build. Kids these days are brought up being rewarded for doing the wrong things. The kids in my classes are rewarded with laughter and applause for yelling obscenities in class and the boys are cheered on during fights and bullying. I watch with horror as a pack of boys my age chase down the weakest boy and beat him, all the while, cheering and laughing at his misfortune. Further, kids are punished for doing right. If you want to help people and support others, you are branded weak and bullied. If you stand out as better than your peers, you are an outsider and will be targeted for being different. This world needs a system to reward people for doing right and punish those who are evil. If people are rewarded for good deeds then the world would gradually become a better place.</p><p><br /></p><p>How do you encourage kids to do things? Games, of course! Kids love games, especially when they are young. Kids love to win at games, what if we turned life into a game? The only way to win is to be a good person and treat each other well. Isn't it cool that games like tag can exist even though nobody has written down the rules? Playground games are spread through word of mouth alone. Wouldn't it be wonderful if our game of life could be spread and shared across the world in the same way. Not as a system of strict rules and laws, but as a set of principles and morals, as thoughts in the minds of kids.</p><p><br /></p><p>I see a world run by kids. A world free from human rights violations and tyranny. Kids are the key to saving this world. One day all the grown-ups of today will be dead and the kids of today will take their place. The Kids will inherit the Earth. If we can teach the kids of today to be good and treat each other as they would like to be treated, then when they grow up to become bosses and prime ministers they will continue to practice good virtues and justice. As people age, all sorts of things happen to their mind and body. Adults have hardened pineal glands and closed minds. Kids are born with clean minds, fresh minds that are only soured by the immoral teachings of grown-ups. The kids that we teach will stay noble forever, they will become grown-ups in name only, inside they are still good little children full of love. They are kids in the bodies of grown-ups, and they will run the world. This is how we can save the world, this is how we can create a world run by kids. Neverland, my dear. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Playground Games</p><p>April 1, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>I know that you want to be a classroom teacher, my love, but is that what the future will look like? Will the Internet not destroy traditional face-to-face teaching? If OSU could provide kids the opportunity to choose their own teachers out of a huge pool of teachers, then physical borders lose their meaning. Would it not be best to give up physical face-to-face teaching and in return be able to become a personal student of one of the best in their field? I am a student of James Corbett. He is my teacher in life and he is a real person. The only reason I could be soooo fortunate to have him as my teacher is because he decided to leave the physical face-to-face teaching methodology and instead dedicate his time to teaching publicly.</p><p><br /></p><p>What beautiful words and thoughts you have, my dear. My God-given mission in this life was to help kids create their own education system. I was never supposed to be the one to create Open Source University. I was just supposed to set up its structures and then assist the kids in making it. Thus, I bow to you. What shall we make this new system, my queen?</p><p><br /></p><p>When I was a small child I had something wrong with my foot. It caused one of my feet to walk outwards, slightly portraying the way a duck might walk. At school they called me duck boy. I always noticed how when people are picked on, no one stands up for them. The school and everybody in it just allows people to be picked on. Growing up I stood up for the weak. I would not allow them to be picked on in my company. But for those efforts I kept getting in trouble. The vigilante is not allowed in the school system but the bully is. How can kids stand around and watch a bully or a group of bullies pick on another kid? Why is people standing up for others so rare?</p><p><br /></p><p>Why is it that people are punished for doing good and rewarded for doing bad? I am shocked with my government because it has no morality department. It cares nothing of morals! Plato created the first academy as a school of thought and reflection as to our moral well being. However, school has evolved into the very opposite of Plato's intentions. They teach you math and science and sports, but they refrain from asking you the question of whether or not you are a good person. Plato's Academy was a place of careful reflection into the very role of our existence. What has happened to our beautiful nation, dear Wendy? They have destroyed everything good and decent. They have illegalised moral action. They have promoted the school bullies into cops.</p><p><br /></p><p>What is it that Jesus Christ stood for? The Old Testament was fulfilled by Jesus and thus mankind could live under faith and no longer laws. The New Testament began our true freedom. But those who refused faith and preferred laws dominated the world and now our world is run by laws that are indiscriminate of faith. A government that will force its values walking all over one's human rights. A fake pandemic gives a great excuse to lock your grip tighter and control a population. Here in Australia, my dear, we have to check in with the government when we go places. Everybody has to tell the government their actions in order to enter certain buildings or eat in a restaurant. Does that sound like freedom? Did Jesus die to bring me this freedom?</p><p><br /></p><p>How do you reward people for doing good? The entire system is rigged from the beginning. The public are doomed to being forced through an education system that harms them. They are becoming bad people through the experiences they are forced to endure within the public education system. After school, you are forced to succeed without experience in shark infested waters and are taken advantage of for your inexperience. You have to figure out how to make a living which is like going around begging for food. Will you employ me so that I can eat every night please? The masses quite literally begging for their own enslavement.</p><p><br /></p><p>What life is there left in our modern day education system? It is without soul and without morals. A new ideology needs to come upon your peers. A game in which is taught through spoken language. A game that every new blessing in the world can find if they only search. A game of morality, fears, and tears. If what we were doing were to be recognised for its value, then we could change a lot of hearts together. The gift of your words open source shall shine upon you all the days of your life. By you opening your mouth, dear Wendy, you are giving hope to our future.</p><p><br /></p><p>One can learn a lot about someone by the teachers that they hold in life. If Brittany Spears is someone's teacher, that element will reflect in their character. The people one chooses to look up to in this life will reflect in the possible lifestyles that they can create. If people are limited in their thinking then they are also limited in the possible results of their lives. Those who see farther can create the implements to get there. The collective is always a step behind the individual.</p><p><br /></p><p>The results of individual action will be remembered if we record it. No one can ever say that or this didn't happen when those events are recorded in time. I cannot be forgotten because my individual actions have impacted many lives. We are immortals in time for doing this. That is what is so brilliant about recording information! The facts are documented through our personalities. The lens of information holds more information than is directly being stated. The background conditions of the creation of the information tell another story than merely the one being asserted. One can read this comprehending all that we have went through or one can read this only understanding the words on top. It is like a lasagna but no comprehension of what is in it. In this way, loyal followers are rewarded with deeper meaning.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Teaching Methodologies</p><p>April 4, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Of course, I would love nothing more than to teach kids in a classroom, my dear. I have had dreams about being a teacher in a classroom of a school hidden in a forest. I believe that face-to-face teaching is the best way for a child to learn. Teaching is all about sharing information, there is only so much information you can share through text. Of course, you know better than anybody that teaching with video is much better than text alone. Let's look at some different methods of teaching for a moment: writing down information in a book is a very effective way of sharing information. We are doing it now. It allows our message to be spread to the widest audience possible. But a book does not allow the student to talk to the teacher. If the book does not explain something very well, the student cannot ask the teacher to rephrase what they said so that the student may understand. The next teaching method is one we are familiar with. Teacher and student writing back and forth to each other. This makes up for what books lack, now the student is able to ask questions directly to the teacher. This is how we started, dear. We used to exchange emails and learn from each other. </p><p><br /></p><p>If this method is combined with the book method, then the teacher is able to reach a wide audience and each student is able to ask questions to the teacher. Let's now consider the method you have mastered: video. Making videos has all the benefits of books but it allows the teacher to give more than they can with writing. It's not just information, the teacher can show so much more emotion through video. Video also lets the teacher sing and make music; try do that with a book. So what's better than books or email or video? Face-to-face teaching. Face-to-face teaching lets the teacher give everything to their students. The teacher isn't limited in any way by the restrictions of words on a page or video. The student is able to show the teacher how they feel about topics. Student and teacher can pick up on subtle body language and tone of voice that can help the other to understand how they feel. I really see face-to-face as the best teaching method, nothing beats it. But I understand that it may not be possible for everyone (even us), I would wish that one day we can bring the magic of face-to-face teaching.</p><p><br /></p><p>I was worried that my writing might seem childish and silly. Thank you for giving me the confidence to write like this, and thank you for teaching me and grooming me so that I am wise enough to write with you. You are the best teacher I have ever had, it is a crime that your Working With Vulnerable People card was taken. You spent years working for that card so that you could be a teacher, then they took it away when they saw that you were too smart to teach. They don't want wise teachers, because they make wise kids, and they know that a generation of wise kids is all that it takes to overthrow them. They want dumb teachers who follow orders because they will form the kids into obedient little robots. The people in power hold on to power by weakening the people. That is why they want us stupid and blind, so we don't see what they are doing. They blind us, so we don't see their horns.</p><p><br /></p><p>What would a world run by kids look like, dear? Would there still be wars? Would there be laws? Do we really need laws to live in peace? What if we just had a set of morals and an ethics code? A set of laws is fixed for all people no matter what their circumstances. Morals are more flexible and can suit each person's needs and circumstances. Robots use strict laws and rules, we are human we have the ability to think morally, why would we reject our morals and use laws? Because laws are for robots and that's what the people in power want us to be. Only in a world run by kids can we truly be human.</p><p><br /></p><p>We must continue to document and write, my dear. And you must continue to make films. We have knowledge and spirit to save this world, even if we fail, what we leave behind must be enough for the next generation to finish what we have started. Just imagine the loss to the world if all of our work was destroyed. You used to write before, and when you were a child you destroyed all of your work. Just imagine how valuable that would have been to our effort. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Curriculum</p><p>April 5, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>You are right in your assessment about face-to-face teaching. I guess I am bias because to me, face-to-face teaching means being abused for who you are. Like you, I have experienced many hardships from face-to-face teaching. I am frightened of people who cannot comprehend what I am saying. Because it is always those fools who get me in trouble just for being me. Face-to-face teaching has a much greater chance of exploiting you than online teaching. In a perfect world, face-to-face teaching would be great. But you said it yourself that you hate your school. You struggle making friendships in your face-to-face classroom. I don't like face-to-face teaching for these reasons.</p><p><br /></p><p>But a traditional school setting offers many benefits. Listen closely to me Wendy: after high school you will never have another chance at such a rich social atmosphere. You are in a school full of people around your age. You get this one opportunity to make friendships that could possibly last a lifetime. After you leave grade school then your social possibilities dwindle. If you are alone after you finish grade school, then it is likely that you will be alone for life. People stop searching for friends after grade school. Instead, they search for sex on Tinder. Use your time in your school to make friends. Stop being so closed to potential friends. I know that you hate it there, but use it to increase your social network. Find friends there that accept that you are with me and that will obtain you friends for life. If a friend accepts you for who you are and who you are engaged to, then cherish that friendship for life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Friendships can be nurtured despite the distance. My best friend from school stayed my best friend up until recently, when he rejected you. But we were always close and used the Internet to have regular conversations. He was my best friend in life from grade 11 all the way up until the end of last year, where he rejected you. But now my best friend is my next door neighbour who knows about you and accepts both you and I. How valuable is my relationship with those around me who accept you? If they accept you, a new life-long friendship is created. Find those friends who will accept you and me and you will find life-long friendships.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am the luckiest guy in the world. You are amazing Wendy. If you are capable of such deep thought at the age of twelve, then imagine what you will become in five or ten years. Imagine what you will be like in fifty years! I invested completely into you because I knew that if you grow upon fertile soil right now, you will become unstoppable in your adulthood. You are much smarter than I was at your age. I didn't have someone like me to guide me towards right and discourage me from wrong. Why is this the best relationship that could ever exist? Because wisdom is the most important thing in life and by you understanding this from your childhood will plant you in the best soil possible. You will become the greatest tree ever seen by mankind because you are battling these subjects as a child that most adults will never entertain. Few will tackle these subjects in their elder years. But you, my angel, are battling the most important subjects to mankind as a child. You are the light of my life. Thank you for being you.</p><p><br /></p><p>I see an electronic education system. The student has no schedule and performs their work with a phone and a laptop. The student has no schedule and comes to the teacher online to ask any questions or discuss any subjects. I very much hate schedules. I want to wake up whenever I feel like it and travel through life dealing with my required duties as I need to. I don't want to have a schedule where I am required to be a certain place at a certain time. I want to be free and take each day as it comes. Face-to-face teaching has limits on teachers. How many children can a face-to-face teacher reach? But an online teacher I could learn from independent of location. My favourite teachers are online teachers and I live through their day to day lives. I learn who they are as a person and over time, connecting deeply with their own psychology. How many people can a face-to-face teacher reach? And how many people can an online teacher reach? An amazing teacher is most effective online and not in the real world. They can reach many more people and their work will go down in history. I find the best online teachers in this world and become their student. This would not be possible if those amazing teachers chose face-to-face teaching instead of online teaching.</p><p><br /></p><p>Adults have major pride issues. They are not willing to hand over their world to kids. Because they lived longer, they have the absolute knowledge that kids do not have. Kids are dismissed as new vessels of knowledge that are reactive and not active. To most adults, kids have no autonomy and are not suitable to make their own decisions in life. Laws then exacerbate the problem by refusing the rights of minors to make decisions regarding their own lives. I am in full agreement with you that laws are not the answer. Living in faith under no laws is the answer. Each situation should be examined carefully because every situation is different. The law should depend on the situation and no activity should be blanket banned. I am not allowed to be with you through laws. But the law is not worried about me. They know that I am doing something illegal and they do not care. The law gave up their jurisdiction on me and handed it to mental health. Yet I stay out of jail regardless of doing something illegal with my entire life. You are my little jailbait, dear Wendy.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are very right, my dear. Laws are created for robots. It is a sad world our past generations have created for us. Morals in our current world have been replaced with cookie cutter laws. Every situation is different and no amount of laws can accommodate every single type of person. Laws hurt us because they are inconsiderate of the situation. They even stop us from taking moral actions because that moral action is illegal. It is a frustrating world when it is illegal to do the right thing.</p><p><br /></p><p>Face-to-face teaching has too many limitations. How can I help a person across the world when I am only teaching those who are near me? The Internet changes our collective psychology. Face-to-face teaching would work in a perfect world. But we are blessed with gifted people in this world like you. Spread your seed across the world. Don't limit yourself by what is in front of you.</p><p><br /></p><p>A sustainable education system is where the kids are the ones telling the adults what to teach. I listen to you every day and attempt to educate you on the topics that are most important in your own life. Our modern day education system doesn't care about what you wish to learn. I am trying my best to learn everything that I can about you, Wendy. I am trying really hard to find out who you are as a person and tailor your education around that information. Every little bit of soul that you give me results in the way I educate you. I educate you around the topics that are important to you and not just a curriculum.</p><p><br /></p><p>If I am to take over your education system, then please see the opportunity that you are presented before you with your current school. I very much want to homeschool you. But that would stop your potential friendships with your current education system. Use this time to find friends. Because you will never again be in a social atmosphere that enables friendships like your current education system. While we are waiting for your father to approve, find friends. Wendy means friend and I very much want you to have lots of friends. Find those who you can ally with now and hopefully, in time, your father will let me be your high school teacher. Get the system to send me your curriculum and we will learn it together. What I do not know now I can learn and teach you. How many kids get the opportunity to have a full-time tutor? You are the lucky one, my dear. Look at all the possibilities you have in life now that I am in it. I love you Wendy Smith. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Student Centred Learning</p><p>April 9, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>In our school, kids are taught to love and respect one another. By prioritizing that, we can stop bullying before it even begins. That's the difference between our school and mainstream schools, if only you knew what the kids at my school were like, you would understand why I don't want to be friends with them. They are horrible people full of hate and disgust for all things good, they want to see this world corrupted by sin. Would you like to know how many people I have met who support our relationship? Zero, my dear. Not one person have I met who actually sees what is good. So, my dear, I simply don't want to be friends with those people. You once told me, "It is better to be alone than to be with the wrong person." They are all the wrong people, my dear. It is not my choice, for I would love to have friends that understand the world, alas, I cannot.</p><p><br /></p><p>Oh my love, thank you for your sweet words of encouragement, know that nothing I do could have happened without you. I simply follow in your step, you are still leagues ahead of me and one day I hope I can match your intellectual prowess. You are a giant I would one day like to stand on the shoulders of. I am the luckiest girl in the world because I have the best teacher in the world. Wisdom is the greatest gift one can give, I want to give that gift to everyone I can. Alas, you are correct, my dear. Face-to-face teaching is too limited. Teachers can only teach a handful of kids, and they have to teach using a schedule that requires kids to obey to the schedule. Maybe you were right from the start. Maybe video is the best form of teaching. Video allows a teacher to give every lesson to thousands of people, the teacher doesn't ever have to repeat a lesson like they would do with face-to-face teaching. Students can still ask questions to the teacher by email or some other way.</p><p><br /></p><p>Or maybe... just maybe... there is something even better. What if teacher and student were to merge lives completely? You know what I'm proposing, don't you? Soon, you and me will be married, and our lives will become one. We will go everywhere together, do everything together, we will spend every second of every day together. We will have all day to teach and learn from each other. There is no need for schedules or to be at certain places at certain times. We will wake up at whatever time we want to. We will take each day as they come. This is the perfect teaching method, my love, and we will do it together, we will show the world what the best way to teach is.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have mentioned that laws are stupid as they don't take into account the fact that each person is different and will have different circumstances. A school curriculum has the exact same problems. Each child is unique and requires different lessons and different teaching methods. You have been cleverly adjusting your lessons with me, teaching me what I need to know in the best ways possible. A curriculum doesn't adjust to fit the student, it's fixed and doesn't change. We don't need a curriculum, dear. You know more about teaching than anyone else, you don't need to be told what to teach me.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you for being the best teacher in the world. Forever, through God's grace. Your Little Ebur. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Life Teacher</p><p>April 10, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>My dear Wendy, don't yet give up on the idea of face-to-face teaching. Just evolve how you think about face-to-face teaching. You are a teacher in this life. You teach online and in real life. We can merge our lives and write and make videos on a flexible schedule for the rest of our lives. But teaching online does not exclude us from teaching face-to-face. Who are our face-to-face students? Everyone who we interact with on a day to day basis. Do you think that my "mental health" treatment team "treat" me without hearing regular philosophy lectures from me? I am preaching both in real life and on the Internet. My real life students are not aware that they are my students. I am grooming everybody that I come into contact with to encourage them to live better lives.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am so sorry that you are rejected because of me. Let that be the bar for potential friendships. If they accept me as your life partner, then they will likely become great lifelong friendships. Hopefully, my childhood friend will become my friend again. But if not, you are worth it. You are worth the destruction of my relationship with my parents. You are worth everything. I invest into you because you have what it takes to save the world. I never said that saving the world would be easy. But live your heart on your sleeve and pour your emotions into the chapters you write. For your heart now not only belongs to me but also the entire world. Your father might be able to stop you from making philosophy videos. But he can't stop you from pouring your heart out to the world in text, and now, voice.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you are serious about you not wanting to become a face-to-face official teacher then your school no longer serves a function. Almost everything that they teach you in it will negatively impact your life as a philosopher. You are in an education system that hurts you and we need to figure out how to remove you from it. How is it fair for your parents to condemn you to a place where you are tortured nearly every day? You are in a place where you don't belong that is psychologically damaging to you. How can parents be so cruel to force such damnation? Nothing you learn in that school will ever outweigh what I can teach you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let's merge our lives together, dear Wendy. Let the student romantically be with the teacher. And let the teacher romantically be with the student. All of my video productions and writings are already merged with you. We are psychologically synced up. You know me better than anyone in this world and I am jealous of your memory. You are a sponge and you soak up information. You will eventually far surpass my own intellectual capacity. Right now I am grounding the moral framework of your intellectual capacity. I am merely pouring the foundations which you will springboard upon. For it is written that you should far surpass me, my Queen.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>"Look, she is coming with the clouds," and "every eye will see her, even those who pierced her"; and all peoples on earth "will mourn because of her." So shall it be! Amen.</p><p>Revelation 1:7</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Your sword is your tongue, my dear. You are much smarter than everyone else in the world. You are learning how to talk circles around people. You are learning how to use logic to win any argument. You are a strong young lady and you have your whole life ahead of you. It is my job to prepare you to live that life to the fullest. The world needs to hear what you say. Your voice is important. What you think and what you feel about things is my drug. I want to know everything about you. Your mind is infinite like mine so if we invest in each other, we will never get bored. We create reality before us while the masses watch us. We are incorruptible because everything we do is free and we have no financial interests. We are driven by our morals and restricted by no laws.</p><p><br /></p><p>A high school degree will do nothing for you, my dear. You are about to become a published author. You are a personal student of a qualified philosopher and teacher. You have no use for their education system. We will be conversing on a much higher level of thought that high school just isn't capable of matching. We will be making videos and writing books our whole life. Adding a high school degree to your qualifications will do little to assist and develop your career.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are a free thinking autonomous individual. You can do what you want as long as you have ample evidence into why you are taking the actions that you are. Even though they fight against logic, they can't beat logic. Logic exists a priori to human experience. We have proven our point before the actual experience. We are right before any hypothesis or conclusion can be asserted. We exist in the realm of common sense that is not very common.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>You gotta fight for your right to party!</p><p>Beastie Boys</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Don't worry about your peers, my love. Because it is you who were invited to Hogwarts and not them. Preach every chance you get. Attempt to show your peers what it means to be a good person. Realise that it is you whom are special. They couldn't make the cut. They are one of the ten virgins who didn't bring extra oil with them and as a result, missed the coming of the Groom. What was the end of that story, my dear? Were they allowed in even though they were late?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you for being my student, my lovely Wendy. Let student and teacher merge and become my teacher. We are now one on the Internet and have merged into each other. From here on out, we will both be making videos and writing books together. All that is left is for us to physically merge. For us to come together physically and, as you say, live life every moment together. I am here for you, dear Wendy. Let me show you the heavens through the actions in which I make on a day to day basis.</p><p><br /></p><p>Don't ever stop being a face-to-face teacher. You are a face-to-face teacher right now. Everybody whom you interact with in life are your students. You must assess their psychology and think about how you can assist them to achieve their dreams. Be a teacher to everybody and reward those who open themselves to learn from you. Be a teacher in life to those around you and be a teacher online here with me.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Wealth of Wisdom</p><p>April 24, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>My sweet love, do not think that I have given up on face-to-face teaching. It is still a dream of mine to teach kids in a classroom. I merely stated that what we have is the best teaching method, it is a shame however, that we can only bond this way with one other person. You and I can share the most wonderful teaching method, but we can't give ourselves to other students. We can still teach lots of kids face-to-face and even more kids online. It's great to hear that you are teaching your mental "health" team about wisdom. I know they will hate you and try to ignore what you say but they will hear you and your lessons will slowly sink in. Unless they are given government issued earplugs to defend themselves against harmful information. "Don't let any rebel teach you wisdom! Try our new anti-dissident earplugs! Our earplugs use new technology to filter out any knowledge that might be harmful to our regime. Buy now and get a free coupon for one injection to alter your DNA!"</p><p><br /></p><p>I knew that people would reject us. I knew what I was getting myself in for, dear. I will continue for look out for other girls who support us, or even just accept us. If I can find some girls who can accept us then I can show them your films and I can have them talk to you so we can teach them so one day they can save the world with us. You should try to find more girls too. But maybe you will have to search in other ways, maybe not online, to find more girls who think like me. Even if we can't find any more girls to fight with us, you are worth losing my friends and family. I would lose everything to be with you, my dear. Not that I would be happy to lose everything, but I am prepared to lose my family and my home. I would even give my life to be with you, my dear. I am very serious about this, I know that as long as we are together, nobody can hurt us. For as long as we are together, we will be okay. Heaven will be beautiful, my love.</p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p><br /></p><p>Dear Lord, when I get to heaven please, let me bring my man. When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in Father, tell me if You can.</p><p>Lana Del Ray</p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p><br /></p><p>Isn't is amazing that you can talk to me about something, then I can take that, build upon it and then give it back to you, and you can take what I say and create new ideas to discuss? Isn't it amazing that without any outside influences, we can literally come up with an infinite number of things to talk about? We can never run out of topics to discuss, because we create new topics using topics we've already discussed. When we finally unite, my dear, we could run away and live in the "bush" (as you call it), because we don't need any one else, we can entertain each other allllll day and alllllll night. Our face-to-face conversations will be magical, my love. We can spend all day filming and teaching our students, then sit in front of a fire and talk for hours and hours. Then sleep side-by-side under the stars. We wake up when we want to, and make films about what we discussed the night before. We can go back to your flat to upload our films and recharge our camera. But we can live outdoors, in God's Country.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Do you really think that God wanted us to live in cramped little concrete boxes? "Here's your very own personal living cube, it's got everything you need to survive but nothing that you need to live." Or did God want us to live in the world that HE MADE FOR US? God made trees for us to climb and shelter under, he made birds to sing for us, he made tasty fruits to nourish us. But what does society do? Society bulldozes those trees and pours a thick layer of concrete over everything God made for us. Their concrete suffocates the Earth; it reminds me of the stone slabs they put on top of graves. That would make the skyscrapers the gravestones wouldn't it? Enormous grave stones of steel and glass, "Here lies a beautiful orchard... that we burnt down to make room for these offices."</p><p><br /></p><p>We don't need money, dear. Not much anyway. We can get by on your pension, maybe I can get one too. Society says, "Buy this! Buy that! You need the latest one of these! Check out our new thing, it's just like the old thing but we changed a few things, buy it now!" They always want you buying more and more stuff, but if you are wise enough to see through the deception, you realise that you actually don't have to keep buying new things all the time, and you can put your money to better uses. We will be able to get by with less money because we're too smart for their lies, dear.</p><p><br /></p><p>And who are the rich ones really, my love? Is it those who spend 12 hours a day in a suit they hate, working in a office they hate, for a boss they can't stand all so that they can buy things they don't really need. Or is it us? We are the intellectual billionaires of this world, and we never had to work a day in our lives to become so. For our minds are rich with wisdom and love, and those can't be bought with money.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>How much better to get wisdom than gold, to get insight rather than silver!</p><p>Proverbs 16:16 </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Grading System</p><p>May 1, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>We have a lifetime of learning and growing together to do. The more you write, the more I learn who you are as a person. We will rarely get bored because we will always have so much to talk about. In addition, I am setting us up with projects. We make videos together under Open Source University. We write books together named anything that our heart desires. When we are united, we can make music albums together. My website is, for the first time, meticulously organised. I will always be working on it to make it better, but its framework has now been successfully implemented. We will live an organised life and we will always have cool projects to work on. Our teaching method is the best because it is two lives uniting into one. But you are very right that other girls don't have the same opportunity as you. There can only ever be one ring on my finger.</p><p><br /></p><p>I think that our school should be directed at young girls. I have thought about this for a long time. We have seen the results of a male philosopher on the Internet of today. To encourage a male to go down this path will result in their abuse. But when beautiful girls start doing this online then they will turn the heads of males. Males will want to watch them talking about philosophy merely because of their looks and personality. Then females will be able to train males to have a heart and care for and respect them. It is you who are Christ because if you can catch the male gaze then you can manipulate it however you want. But with such power comes great responsibility. Thus, everything you teach should come from your heart and you should be gentle with men. Be appealing physically, intellectually, and emotionally. When you show your face you will be leading the future female philosophers of the world.</p><p><br /></p><p>Living in the wilderness for years taught me many lessons. Being one with the land and the animals on it is a beautiful experience. Living in the wilderness is illegal in many countries. In Australia, only someone transient can live in the wilderness. Because eventually authorities will push them off the land. This means that building a little space for yourself is not possible. If you live in the wilderness, you can only live with what you can carry. I spent many years traveling around Australia looking for a good place to live. The cities have no nature and the countries require a vehicle to commute. But then I came to the ACT. Canberra is known as "the bush capital" because it has all the advantages of a city but it's covered with wilderness. I am just a short bus trip away from a beautiful mountain that we could track whenever we want. I want you to come live with me here in Canberra. It gets cold in the winter and hot in the summer. It is much warmer than you are used to in England.</p><p><br /></p><p>All of the odds are against us. I don't think Australia will allow you in on a fiancé visa until you are eighteen. But don't discredit such ideas so fast. Six years of training you on the Internet could be wonderful. The world would see our relationship develop and eventually, be united. We are merging digitally right now. We are learning to speak out in one voice. Open Source University is our project and we do with it whatever we like. Stand as my queen and lead an army of young girls to victory. Show them what it means to be a woman. And love them like a mother. People will follow us. People already follow us. We will change many lives. We have the rest of our lives to do this. People will notice us. We won't be invisible forever.</p><p><br /></p><p>It doesn't matter where we live. I would love to stay in Canberra because the weather is great and it is a beautiful city. But where we live isn't too important. All that matters is that we live together. Canberra is an easy option because I am already established here. And Canberra is the most beautiful city that I have ever lived. I have good friends and good support networks. We can live wherever God directs us but maybe that is Canberra?</p><p><br /></p><p>You are such a gorgeous soul. Every chapter you give me provides me deep insights not only into you as a person, but also society as a whole. You are my reflection and your words sound like me. Opposites do not attract. Opposites destroy each other. We are complementary to each other. We are male and female versions of the same soul. Let us use our lives to show the world what a perfect relationship looks like. People of this world use false proverbs like, "opposites attract" to justify the terrible relationships they choose. It is obvious that you have to settle with your opposite because no one can ever find anyone similar to them. This world uses many social axioms to justify the terrible choices and terrible lifestyles in which they live. Let us represent the perfect couple with our lives to all of society.</p><p><br /></p><p>For education is life. Education is not a school that one attends. It is not a qualification which one obtains. It is not a status earned in society. Education is touching the stove when it is hot. Education is being disciplined for making morally sound actions. It is learning how to speak to those you hate. It is learning how to live a happy life. It is doing the right thing despite the negative consequences that such actions will incur. Education is learning to accept yourself and not blame yourself for the hardships in life that helped create you. Education is learning how to live the perfect life both in God's eyes and your own. For the Kingdom of Heaven is found within. Enlightenment is a state of mind where no bad can come to you because you are at peace with yourself. Everything that is thrown at you in life is a test from God. When you realise this you will shine because you will want to do your best for God to show Him how capable you are. Make God smile in every action. Be a star and be a shining example to your peers and audience. For you are Super Wendy! Nothing that this world throws at you can stop you.</p><p><br /></p><p>To succeed in this world you need to have the right frame of mind. You need to be told your true capabilities. You need to be rewarded when you shine. Do you think that prime ministers and presidents are successful? Do you think that they are happy when they die? Do you think that they live happy lives? What does it mean to succeed? Does someone who worked their entire life to purchase a house die happy? Do the nine to five slaves leave this world with a feeling of accomplishment? What will you be remembered for in life? What are you leaving behind? Were you a benefit or hindrance to the positive development of this this world? The masses of this world think that there are no consequences for their actions. They think that will neither be rewarded or punished for the actions in which they take in life. As a result the populace invests their time in wicked behaviour because that is most beneficial short-term. They try and tear down all those around them so that they feel better about themselves. Because if they are trash and those around them are trash then they have nothing or no one to live up to. Don't let them pull you down to Hell. Let me lift you up to the heavens!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>We Can Fly</p><p>May 23, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>My true love, my heart belongs to you. I have abandoned my school of lies in favor of your teachings. I was able to escape during my lunch break; I wonder who will even notice my absence. I wonder if anybody there will miss me. It matters not though what they think, they are lost souls. They wander aimlessly though the thick fog of lies and confusion that is swept up by those in power, such that the masses are never knowing of there own enslavement. Only those in the highest of towers are able to peer above the fog. A  poor ground dweller of the masses is deep within the blinding fog and is so in the dark about their own existence that they cannot see their own hand in front of their face. Alas, if only they were offered some light then they would finally be able to see the shackles on their wrists. We live atop a great mountain of wisdom, my dear, far above the fog. We can be a guiding light for these lost souls, my love. We can shine with the light of the heavens and reach down a caring hand for those who are lost. We can guide them out of there dark depths and show them the way up our mountain.</p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p><br /></p><p>If anyone causes one of these little ones--those who believe in me--to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.</p><p><br /></p><p>Matthew 18:6</p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p><br /></p><p>Alas, I lament. Perhaps the divine light of Heaven will prove too bright for those who have never used their eyes before. Perhaps some of them will become blinded by such a light, those who are will never see again and shall be doomed to walk the Earth a blind servant of mainstream. I'm sure you have seen this happen before, when someone is so in the dark about the truth they may reject reality entirely. The harder you try to show them the truth, the harder they shut there eyes and cover their ears. Trying to save these people would be like trying to pull a snail out of its shell, you can use brute force and pull as hard as you can, but the snail will just retreat hide within its shell. Instead leave some food outside its shell and let the snail come out by himself. Perhaps we can lure those lost souls in the direction of our mountain and let them find there own way out of the fog. For there is no darkness the divine light cannot touch.</p><p><br /></p><p>The fog has been sturred up by those in the tallest of towers. One day, my love, we shall topple their towers and watch them collapse. The higher their tower, the further they shall fall, and they will fall all the way to Hell, my dear. One day we shall blow away the fog of lies and let everybody see. It will take a long time to do this, dear, it might not happen within our lifetimes. Just as you have inspired me, I will inspire more people, and if we can't save the world, our followers surely will.</p><p><br /></p><p>Just as you said, my parents have grounded me for my actions, I still refuse to go to school, so they refuse to give me my laptop. I have been forced to write this out on paper in my imprisonment, just like when you were locked up, dear. You wrote to me on paper when you were abducted. I will try to get to the library so I can type this up and send it to you. I hope you are doing well in my absence. I hope you are still making films. They want me to go back to "school" and stop talking to you and they want me to give up my engagement ring. I hope you can find a way to stop them from giving you injections. It is horrible that they knowingly violate your religion. I want to help you by writing that character witness, but don't really understand what it is or how to write it. My heart is being torn apart when I'm not with you. Every night I cry, every night I pray that I will wake up in your bed. I don't want to live in this house anymore. I need to be with you, my love. I need to feel your arms around me. I need to feel my hand in yours. I need to feel my lips against yours, my love. I'm not afraid to admit to the world that I want to be your wife. I want to be your lover. Forever through God's grace, my love.</p><p><br /></p><p>Last night I had a dream, my love. I dreamed that I was laying in a four poster bed that rich people have. I dreamed that the wind was howling and battering at the window. The window was suddenly blown open by the wind and the wind immediately fell silent, the air was completely still. I looked out of the open window and saw the moon in the sky. I could see something odd about it so I squinted my eyes and focused on it. I could just about make out a person sitting cross legged on the moon. I saw him watching me. We stayed there for some time, just staring at each other. After some time he stood up and I watched with awe as he began to walk out towards me on a bridge of stars. Each star drifted into formation just before each step he took. I watched with amazement as he walked gracefully all the way to my window. It was you, my love. I could see your face now. You looked beautiful. You seemed to glow slightly with a white light that shone into my room. You walked to the side of my bed and looked at me without saying a word. You had this beautiful smile on your face and your eyes were the brightest blue I've ever seen. You reached out a glowing hand and graced my cheek. You brought your face close to mine and I saw the infinite depths of your eyes, like two magical oceans. You moved in and gave me a long slow kiss that infused my body with a warm glow. I felt you begin to pull your head up but I didn't want it to end, and I began to feel my self rising up. My bed covers slipped away and I was floating above my bed, glowing, joined to you by our lips. We floated silently out of the window and up into the sky.</p><p><br /></p><p>Teach me to fly, Peter Pan.</p><p><br /></p><p>██████░░████░░░████░░██░░░░██</p><p><br /></p><p>░░██░░░██████▄██████░░░░░░░░░</p><p><br /></p><p>░░██░░░░███████████░░██░░░░██</p><p><br /></p><p>░░██░░░░░░███████░░░░██░░░░██</p><p><br /></p><p>░░██░░░░░░░░███░░░░░░██░░░░██</p><p><br /></p><p>██████░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░██████░ </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Light Work</p><p>May 25, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>My dearest Ivory, you have experienced such hardships as of late. I am so sorry for your suffering, but fear not, for your toils will in time be greatly rewarded. Please take this opportunity to share with the world your experiences attempting to quit school. Preach with me using this book about a new education system. The background conditions must match the theory being proposed. By you quitting school for a better education system proves that you believe in this education system and acts as an example to other kids in a similar situation as you. Your hardships will be exemplified to all who stumble upon your work. Do not be sad, for your suffering will in time, help others. In addition, this is giving you great experience as well as a story to tell not only the world, but also our kids.</p><p><br /></p><p>This world is far too complex for any individual to comprehend anything within it. Huge corporations have systematised work, rendering individuals of no significance. The system only cares about the collective. The individual is excluded from it. There are no people anymore, just entities. There is no longer accountability in work, for the problems always fall on the hierarchy. It matters not whom you speak with, they are never responsible for any of the problems that their organisation inflicts. No one person is responsible and no organisation can be held responsible because an organisation is not a sentient being. The days of morality and responsibility are over. People can commit whatever dastardly deeds they wish and there is never anyone or anything that will accept responsibility or induce positive change.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let me explain this with an example of the gaming industry. The same theory applies to all employment, however, this example outlines the situation very clearly, since games are our life. One person cannot create a popular game. Even a small team of people are not capable of creating an extensive game. John Heywood created the axiom, "Many hands make light work." Nothing can ever succeed in this world individually. A collective is required to approve of thoughts and ideas. A triple A game (AAA) is a game that has been developed by a large team of individuals working on a very large budget. Many hands make the game, removing any identifiable individualistic identities. The buildings you call tombstones were designed and constructed by a very large number of people. This modus operandi strips individual values and morals from projects as well as removes a sense of accomplishment from individuals. Individuals are just robots, following the protocols implemented by the organisation. Community projects have been replaced by global projects. We are no longer working for our local community but instead, a global elite who wish to push their agendas on the masses.</p><p><br /></p><p>No one comprehends how anything works anymore. Our employment system is designed to give a specific role that focuses on a small aspect of the whole. The entire system is extremely complex and no one comprehends the bigger picture. Employees are each given duties that work for the benefit of the globalist agenda, however, the individual has no capacity to see that as they are merely working on a small part of the system. How does electricity work, dear Wendy? How many people are there in this world that truly comprehend how electricity or even electronics work? What is magic, my darling? Microchip manufacturers, psychiatrists, and politicians are all practicing black magic. Organisations patent everything to ensure that no one person can ever comprehend what it is they are doing. Currently I am typing on my computer with my space heater turned on warming me. My television acts as my second monitor and my Nintendo Switch sits here beside me ready to be played at any moment. My phone shares Internet to all of my wireless devices. I know nothing about how this equipment functions. I am interacting with a spell that has been placed upon me.</p><p><br /></p><p>Despite my life studies in the information technology industry, I am still oblivious to how any of it works. This is not because of my own stupidity because I trained with many other IT professionals who also didn't comprehend how anything works. We are taught how to interact with the technology as it exists. Little to no information is ever revealed as to how this equipment is actually functioning, nor can anyone learn because of the constant patents. And even if there was no copyright placed upon the technology, one person would still remain oblivious to its functionality no matter how hard they studied. Because it took many hands to make light work, so the vast wealth of information will be too difficult for any one person to understand. I make videos without comprehending how the technology works. I create images in Photoshop without comprehending how the application functions. We are given interfaces like Photoshop to accomplish our goals, however, those interfaces are full of code that works in between the user and the binary data. We use premade tools to build our lives without comprehending how those tools function. To create tools we use other tools that we have no comprehension as to their coded functionality.</p><p><br /></p><p>Why am I telling you all of this? What conclusion am I pointing to? This world is going to burn. There is no hope for a positive future for our species. The damage has been done and there is no reversing it. Political correctness rules the direction our collective psychology travels. An example is the LGBTQIA+ agenda, which wishes to remove gender identities from our society. Too much damage has been done and there is no way to reverse the process. Humans have grown to love the comforts that magic and its results have generated for them. They won't give up their copyright and they won't give up their technology. We are here, my dear Wendy, to save as many people as we can before the end of the world. We are not here to save the world. We are here to destroy it and create a new one.</p><p><br /></p><p>What does the end of the world look like? The masses laugh at the homeless guy standing on the sidewalk with a sign that says, "The end is nigh." The end of the world does not mean the destruction of all "humans". I would be very surprised if "human" life was eradicated from this planet. Are humans humane? The end of the world is where no humanity is left. The end of the world is when the masses alter their genetic structure to the point where they are no longer human as we know it. The destruction of the Earth is when no humanity is left within the hearts of humans. The end is a world filled with robots that have little to no emotions left in them. For this world is destined to become the new Hell.</p><p><br /></p><p>The world is too far gone to be fixed. People won't listen to reason and logic. They reject what is good for them in favour of what is bad for them. They oppress individuals who try to show them the error of their ways. The masses are self-righteous despite not caring about morality. There is no healing this kind of sickness. The sickness is passed on through the generations and the populace prides themselves in their illness. Our job in this world is not to fix it. Our job is to try and expose to the few real humans who are left in this world all of these problems. All we have to do is get through life and then live out the rest of eternity in Heaven. We are not working for this life. We are working for the afterlife. This life will bring us hardships and struggles. This life isn't fair and will torture us. But the end will land us walking hand in hand atop streets of gold.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Character Reference</p><p>June 12, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>To whom it may concern,</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell Charles NeSmith is the wisest and most amazing person I have ever met. Since October 25th, 2020 we have been talking to each other online and in that time we have fallen in love. I love Wendell because he is the only person who truly understands and cares about me, he makes me feel special in a way that nobody else can. I love Wendell because he treats me with respect and doesn't treat me like a kid; we are able to discuss very mature and personal topics with each other without any fear of judgement or rejection. I love Wendell because he is the best teacher I have ever had; he can teach me about any subject better than any of the "teachers" at school can. Wendell is an amazing teacher because he doesn't just share facts and information with you, he actually knows how to press your buttons and get you to feel whatever emotion you have to in order to understand something. That's the mark of a good teacher. Do their kids simply know something? Or do they truly and intimately understand it?</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell has been teaching me about God and the world we live in. He teaches me things that other "teachers" are too afraid to teach: the truth. Wendell has taught me the truth about the COVID pandemic (scamdemic) and the Freemasons that control governments and companies. As soon as I am able to, I will move to Australia to live with the man I love, as is my right to do so. Love is the most powerful force and nothing will come between two lovers.</p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p><br /></p><p>But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’ ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</p><p>Mark 10:9</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell and I are currently running a school called Open Source University and writing a book by the same name. All classes from Open Source University are free and offer an unparalleled insight into Wendell's wonderful mind. We are going to find more girls to teach. We want to teach wisdom to as many young girls as possible. Young girls are the key to saving the world; saving the world is our mission from God. The world is full of horrible people, people who want to lock up my lover because they don't like what he teaches. We will save the world from these kinds of people.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please don't take my lover away. Wendell gives me a reason to live, he is the reason I wake up in the morning. He helps me when nobody else will. He has helped me to stop hurting myself and has saved me from suicide. When we die we will be united in Gods kingdom of Heaven and if you don't allow us to be together in this life, that's fine, we will have an eternity together in Heaven. There is nothing you can do to keep us apart, but if you try to do so, you are surly damning you own soul and the souls of everyone on this planet. Let us be together so that we may save the souls of the world.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Trust in God,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendy </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Peer Support</p><p>July 8, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>My dear Wendy, you would not believe how much effort I have spent throughout life to find television worth watching. I thought that if the government labelled me as psychotic, I could spend my life watching amazing people live their lives through the Internet. I thought that the people would be able to educate and entertain me. I thought that I would be able to fill my life with wise people who could share with me their wisdom.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have spent my life searching for edutainment. Who thought it would be so hard to find wise people who give their lives in video to teach about wisdom? I have found a handful of these people, but even their content is unable to entertain me for long. Few I follow all of their videos. And none will talk to me. I just wanted wise friends who post videos about philosophy. I just wanted a community of some of the brightest souls to come together and talk about big subjects. I was attempting to create a theatre in which a group of philosophy driven personalities could come together to discuss the most important subjects of humankind. I just have faith because if I am such an individual and there are almost eight billion people in the world, then there must be others. I can not be alone in my passion about these subjects. You are my first, my Queen.</p><p><br /></p><p>As a student of Open Source University, one must make videos about philosophy. You must use your personality to win over your desired audience. You are to entertain the types of people you would want to be friends with. You will get haters, lovers, despisers, and stalkers.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”</p><p>Matthew 4:19</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The storms are rough and seas prevail. But we are fishing for big game. Many will spit upon the ground that we walk on. But a life on the land feels much safer. The sharks are out all around us. And our tears of blood will shed into the water. The sharks will try and defeat us. But we are more clever than them. Eventually, my beautiful, we will have a family. In time some people will see what we are talking about. In time we will have allies.</p><p><br /></p><p>Imagine an education system that consists of video content producers sharing their knowledge. Imagine if you were presented a bunch of educational video channels and told to make your own school. Imagine how diverse our world could become if your teachers were hand picked by yourself. You could learn a lot from them as well as fall in love with their personality. How many "teachers" have you had in which you loved their personalities? School created by yourself by following the teachers in which capture your heart is the future of education. There is no future in being assigned teachers who are employed to indoctrinate you into lies. Those who excel most in this type of education system would in time also become video content producers.</p><p><br /></p><p>How are we to advertise such a system? By word of mouth. I promote this education system by the very films I produce. So will you. And so will all of my students who are brave enough to press the record button. And so will your students who are brave enough to press the record button. In time, students become teachers and teach this education system to their students who also teach this education system to their students. Although at first the process will be slow, in time it will grow exponentially. What started off as just one person with an ideal will eventually turn into how the world views education. If we manage to connect with the children then they will lead our world into its new golden age.</p><p><br /></p><p>None of this is unrealistic. By making videos about philosophy like this, we stand as an example to others. If kids were only taught this concept of education then our world would rapidly change. Eventually, the smartest of children could teach their peers. All of this was created to pry the education system out of the government's hands. It exists to show a better method of education that cannot be corrupted. It was made to destroy curriculums and replace them with self-paced learning from individuals whom you respect. The goal of Open Source University is to free education: free financially and free speech. Eventually the education system will prove itself as others take on the task of becoming a content creator.</p><p><br /></p><p>I could have implemented OSU with science or history or mathematics, but instead I chose philosophy. This is an attempt to save the world because wisdom has been rejected as a valid field of study. Out of all that I have learned in my life, philosophy has assisted me the most. Knowing how to make wise decisions will build your life. Science doesn't teach me how to ethically live my life. History doesn't teach me how to recognise lies and find the truth. In fact, most of the history taught is lies! And mathematics doesn't teach me how to weigh up decisions that could be right or wrong. Philosophy teaches me how to live a good life.</p><p><br /></p><p>What is philosophy? The name comes from two Greek words: philia and sophia. The love of wisdom. Philosophy focuses on many different subjects but it is key to understand that if one isn't concerned about the love of wisdom in their investigations, they are not doing philosophy. One doesn't have to read Plato or Kierkegaard or Nietzsche in order to do philosophy. One merely needs to set out on an adventure to extract wisdom from situations and theories. Do this on camera and gain enlightenment.</p><p><br /></p><p>Learn how to tell stories with your life, dear Wendy. Learn to look at the day to day events in your life as important and analyse them. I want you to tell me about your experiences in school. Don't worry too much about the content they are feeding you at your school. Instead, focus on human interaction and closely examining its properties. Notice when people are cruel to others. Think about all of the problems you see and how you can resolve them. Learn to tell stories about your life, my love. Because this ability will give you the capacity to create very moving and engaging films.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>If you build it, [they] will come.</p><p>Field of Dreams</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>The six degrees of separation theory asserts that the entire world is connected by six or fewer mutual relationships. By reaching the few, we can in time reach the many. We do this by helping one person at a time. The more videos I make, the more people I reach. The more videos my students make, the more people they reach. Open Source University was built upon solid foundations and provides the framework to a truly free education system. The more we talk about it in this life, the more people we will reach. In time, this will both save and destroy the world. For dark forces are in control of this fallen world. Let us shine our light.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Happy Birthday!</p><p>September 3, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell:</p><p>Happy Birthday Wendy! Congratulations! You are now a young adult.</p><p>https://youtu.be/c5rVbQ-KtI0</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendy:</p><p>Thats beautiful dear.</p><p>I love you sooooo much. Finding you was the best thing that ever happened to me. <3</p><p>I also watched your other film, its obvious to me that the people of this world dont want our help. Why would they continue to oppress us if they did?</p><p>If a person is drowning and you try to rescue them, but they grab onto you and begin to drag you down with them, what choice do you have? Either try your best to help them, then you both drown. Or recognize the situation and do what you can to protect yourself. There is no sense in being dragged down by the willfully blind. We tried to save the world, but these people are not ready to be saved. Better it is, for us to save what we can and leave this drowning planet. Come with me dear. Leave this poor place, and join me in God's Kingdom of Heaven.</p><p><br /></p><p>I love you baby.</p><p>Please don't leave me waiting.</p><p>*kiss*</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell:</p><p>We tried to save this planet but they didn't want to be saved. So now we save our own lives (lives as in living). Heaven is a long way aways, my dear. Let's focus on building good lives for us here on Earth. Some will listen to us and year after year we will get more followers. Don't worry about saving the world dear. Just try. They don't want to be saved. Let's just build a life together and throw life preservers to those who have ears to listen.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendy:</p><p>This world is no place for wise people like us. We dont belong here.</p><p>How many years have you been writing?</p><p>How many years have you been making films?</p><p>And how many students do you have?</p><p>How many kids have graduated from Open Source University?</p><p>What makes you think that by writing more books and making more films you will somehow amass more followers?</p><p>Dont be sad, dear. Your writing is eloquent and thought provoking, and your films are beautiful and entertaining. Your music is magical and makes me feel sooo many amazing feeling. You are a gorgeous man and its a pleasure to have an intelligent discussion with you. You are the only man i'll ever love, Wendell.</p><p>You are too good for this world, these people dont deserve a wonderful man like you. They ought to feel honored by your presence, they should be listening intently to your every word. They should have made you the prime minister of Australia.</p><p>But, what did they do? They treated you like a criminal, they walked all over you and they despise you. They are swine, dear. Do not cast your pearls of wisdom unto them.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell:</p><p>You are right Wendy. I have been writing ever since I can remember. I have been making films for over 10 years. My only student is you. No one has graduated from Open Source University except me. Writing more books and making more films will slowly bring more gawkers in.</p><p><br /></p><p>But that isn't the point, my dear. I am doing what I love doing. My life has been dedicated to all of the things in life that I enjoy most. How many people have that opportunity? Maybe it is true that they treat me like a criminal, but at the end of the day, I spent my life doing awesome stuff and they wasted theirs.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let's make our own world within a world. If you want to leave this world so bad then make your own with me. We might have to live in their world but we can create a counter-culture within it.</p><p><br /></p><p>And you must realise that I did all of this to find you. My objective was not to become famous. My objective was to find you. I achieved what I wanted.</p><p><br /></p><p>Now we spend the next 5 years doing stuff on the Internet together and when you turn 18 we will fly you over here and get married.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendy:</p><p>I cant live with my parents for another day, never mind 5 years.</p><p>I've already made up my mind dear. I just wanted you to come with me.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell:</p><p>Does this mean you are breaking up with me? I spent my life fighting against suicide, I will not succumb to it. I wanted a wife in this life and the next. Suicide won't bring you to where you want to be. You are not thinking straight. This life can be beautiful but you have to make it. It sounds like you are just bailing out of your responsibility to make your own life. We don't choose our family and parents can be difficult. But you have to learn how to not let them push you around.</p><p><br /></p><p>Something better than suicide? Scratching your father's car. Key it up really good. And when you get in trouble for it, tell your father that you were going to kill yourself but your fiance told you to scratch his car instead.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendy:</p><p>I already scratched his car, he got angry and hit me again.</p><p>Of course im not breaking up with you, dear. This is how we can come together.</p><p>Im not afraid because i know that where I wake up tomorrow will be a better place than this.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell:</p><p>We don't come together by suicide. I will NOT commit suicide. Why don't you call child protective services? Become an orphan. Has to be better than what you are experiencing now. Can't you understand, you just turned 13. You can get a job now and become independent. You have your whole life ahead of you now and you just need to figure out how to solve the problems in your life causing you sadness.</p><p><br /></p><p>It sounds like you are breaking up with me right now.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendy:</p><p>I'll never break up with you dear.</p><p>Weather you choose to come with me tonight or not, I'll still love you no matter what.</p><p><br /></p><p>I love you Wendell *kiss*</p><p><br /></p><p>-Yours, forever through God's grace.</p><p>Wendy Ebur NeSmith</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell:</p><p>I wanted you so bad in this life and the next. But it looks like God has other plans. We are now broken up Wendy. Have a good rest of your life, however long that may be.</p><p><br /></p><p>Love,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell Charles NeSmith</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Beauty in Life</p><p>September 12, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>How should I feel? My entire life mission has just failed. What was Wendy? Was she really who she said she was or was she just a hater that wanted me to kill myself? The truth is that there is no way that she could have loved me because you don't encourage someone you love to kill themselves. But maybe she was just a mixed up girl. It is sad but there is nothing that I can do. Suicide has been haunting me ever since my childhood. Why are there so many people in this world that tell other people to kill themselves? Do people not realise how precious life is?</p><p><br /></p><p>The production company behind Open Source University has always been Divine Tragedy. This is a divine tragedy. From the beginning I have always known how all of this was going to turn out. I didn't know all of the little details but I knew the bigger picture. I have been prepared for this for a long time now. I knew that eventually the end would come.</p><p><br /></p><p>All of this because I wanted kids to be the founders of Open Source University. I have spent my life seeking out kids that want to build their own education system. But too little, too late, I guess. I thought that if I could find a partner that was young, we could spend the rest of our lives together developing the education system. Then the education system would have been built upon solid foundations, the background conditions proving the model.</p><p><br /></p><p>I just wanted to live in a world where the young are taught by their peers. As Ghandi suggested, be the change you want to see in the world. I wanted so much to enable kids to make and develop their own education system. But the world fought back on every turn and I have now been beaten. There is no more fighting. Everything that could have been done has been done. The world doesn't want such social evolution. Peer-based education is a concept that can't work when you have so many people running around demanding obedience.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some children are very gifted in certain areas. If they focused on teaching those areas to their peers, then they could replace the teacher with the student. Although such a system is best implemented on the Internet, the same theory applies in face-to-face teaching. Teachers need to become more like moderators in guiding the classroom to fruition. Teachers should empower the students to teach each other.</p><p><br /></p><p>Nothing more can I do to find my soul mate. Nothing more can I do to find a like mind. Nothing more can I do to get her attention. Nothing more can I do to broadcast this message. I have no more heart to pour out. It feels though the entire world has turned its back on me. I have an entire thread dedicated to insulting me. For giving myself to the world I was slaughtered.</p><p><br /></p><p>How is a hopeless romantic to find love in a world devoid of it? How can I find a soul that will merge into mine? One life and not two lives. What is there left in this world for me? I only get older. How appropriate for a hopeless romantic to die alone. What more is there for me in this world?</p><p><br /></p><p>Emotions are the most powerful force known to humankind. If you are reading my work without them, then you are reading my work wrong. How we feel about things manifests the reality that we exist within. Feeling deeply will mature you as a person. Those who are not emotional beings are losing out in what life has to offer. Emotions are beautiful and don't let anyone tell you any differently.</p><p><br /></p><p>Life doesn't always turn out the way we want it to. But that doesn't mean that life is worth giving up on. Things might end up pear shaped, but it is experience that we lived through. We will become a wiser tree as we live through the harsh weather conditions. Life is not for giving up. Life is for making it everything that you can. No suffering is in vain because the blemishes eventually shine into beauty, if your heart is in the right place. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>The End</p><p>October 18, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>This will be the final chapter of this book. I have reached out to Wendy several times in attempts to learn of her well-being but alas, I have not heard back from her. I wish I could have helped her but I was unable to truly reach her.</p><p><br /></p><p>Open Source University might have failed but imagine if it succeeded. Imagine if kids ran their own education system. Imagine if that education system encouraged the most entertaining of them to thrive as teachers to their peers. A classroom of kids being talked at is no longer an effective method of teaching kids now that we have technology. The question we have to answer as a society is who the future teachers are going to be. Online teachers will in time dominate the field. But what types of teachers are worth creating?</p><p><br /></p><p>This book was supposed to be 27 chapters. This was because Wendy was born on the 9th month of the year, third day and 9x3=27, which is the day I was born on the 6th month of the year.</p><p><br /></p><p>Unfortunately this book was not able to put into action my ideology. But it was not of waste because at least it was able to convey what it is I have in mind when I say the words "Open Source University". Not all stories have a happy ending but it is up to us how we choose to react to those situations. I did everything in my power to help Wendy and lift her up as high as she could reach. I expected too much of her, for alas, she is only young. Or old. To be honest I don't know who Wendy is.</p><p><br /></p><p>My future will no longer search for youth who are interested in education. I will drop the aspiration to become a school teacher. What I wanted failed so I am going to stand back and let God take over my life and just follow what doors God opens up. I might be beat up but I am not beaten. The only true failure is giving up. I will no longer describe my future wife. I will let her be whatever she is. I will let her be no one of that is God's Will.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am sorry that I could not help you Wendy. I tried very hard to be supportive of you. It is sad how your chapter ended. If only it could have been something else. If only you could see the things I am saying. Alas, you are blinded by fear.</p><p><br /></p><p>Suicide is not the answer. God is with you always so never feel alone. The path to freedom is through hard work and dedication. Nothing worthwhile is easy. The previous steps will lead you to your future steps. Life is only one step at a time. Do not fret, for God will never forsake you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Adam Brown keeps contacting me telling me that I killed a kid and I belong in jail. If Wendy was real and has passed away, her father killed her and not I. I was not the one abusing. I was always supportive of Wendy and encouraged her to reach the stars. She was the one obsessed with suicide and not I. And she self-harmed because of the abuse from her father.</p><p><br /></p><p>I feel bad about what happened but I don't blame myself. I tried very hard to help a disturbed girl. Maybe I failed but I gave it my all. The measure is not whether you succeed or fail but how much heart you put into it. Society would disagree with that statement but I disagree with society. Because of all of my negative past experiences, I possess an extremely high emotional intelligence. Because I gave my heart freely to those who abused it, I came out a very emotionally aware individual.</p><p><br /></p><p>But alas, I cannot continue on the same path, for my heart has learned the lessons from our past. What I want is changing. Society is rapidly changing with the pandemic. My choice is very limited. It is time to reinvent myself. I like the idea of just being a humble man who accepts his past. Just living in the moment and not worrying about what, if anything, is to come next. After much struggling in life, I now live comfortably. I worked very hard over the last ten years with videos. Maybe it is time to retire. Try and do something more rewarding with my time that won't end up with me being harassed.</p><p><br /></p><p>My videos taught me to be the person I am today. I had many adventures and misadventures. But I was honest and recorded both the good and the bad. This then cast me out of society because of my honesty. I gave an open heart and they crucified it. But I have risen and it is time for me to begin a new life with my father in Heaven. I will just focus my life entirely around God. I give the desires of my heart to God. Do with me as you will, God. Although my videos just shame myself, making and releasing them developed me as a person. So even though I no longer want anyone to see my videos, making them captured my moral development over time and gave me deep insight into who I am as a person. No video was in vain.</p><p><br /></p><p>Who was Wendy? She refused to verify herself as a person. She never sent me a photograph showing her face. I was supposedly engaged to her and she refused to show me her face. Packages sent to her address were returned to sender with a "person not at this address" reason. The only photograph that she sent me was a month and a half after we met, which I later found out to actually be the photograph of a porn star. And towards the end she would only contact me every three weeks or so.</p><p><br /></p><p>I tested Wendy with this book. It doesn't make sense why she would write chapters like this if she was just a troll. Until the end she put a lot of effort into writing chapters. I just don't understand why she gave up. If she was who she said she was then she should have called child services. It is better to live as an orphan then under the conditions in which she described. But alas, I can't tell truth from lies. She is an unverified person through her own will. I respected that because I loved her mind. But she couldn't ride that card forever and she knew it. Or was she a she? How can I know? I have never even heard her voice. Whoever Wendy is or was, I wish her the best. If she has passed then I pray that her pain is gone and she can live peacefully in the afterlife that she idealised.</p><p><br /></p><p>It may be true that Open Source University failed. But imagine if it succeeded. Imagine the type of world we would live in where the students make their own education system. Just because I failed in everything that I set out for does not mean that other people will also fail in this task. Everybody is different and has different odds of implementing this system. My faith is not destroyed: merely my life. But I am just one out of many. There is a chance that one day the collective will begin to see the benefits in what I have said. Maybe I have no one to pass this legacy to but the wheel will in time be reinvented. People do not need to view my work to realise the problems that I identify. So it is now time for me to perish away in the background. I pray for one day that my work is recreated by some dedicated followers of God. My work can pass away but it would be such a shame if so did the concepts that it introduced. For without God, I am nothing. And through God all things are possible. So what if I failed at conveying these truths to the collective.
