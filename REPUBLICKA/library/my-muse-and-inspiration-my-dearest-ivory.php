Dear Ivory,<div><br></div><div>I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to share with you the immense joy I find in telling you mythology stories. Through my work, I have come to a profound realization: you are the very essence of my focus and inspiration. This clarity has guided me to understand what is most important to convey to you.</div><div><br></div><div>Given your philosophical nature, I sought a way to present deep and meaningful ideas in an entertaining and captivating manner. Mythology offers a perfect medium to communicate intense and complex emotions, allowing us to explore the depths of the human experience together.</div><div><br></div><div>By creating my own philosophical world, rooted in Greek mythology, I have become the hero of my own story. This journey has garnered a following of people who cheer me on and share in the adventure. Greek mythology has provided a strong foundation upon which I have built my new life, enabling me to think deeply, love passionately, and enjoy every moment of this quest.</div><div><br></div><div>Yet, despite all this, there remains one missing piece— you, the central figure of my story. Every word I write, every tale I tell, is spoken directly to you. My audience comes to understand your significance even before they fully grasp who I am, for you are my muse and my guiding light. I am determined to become a great poet in your name, dedicating every verse and every story to you.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and devotion,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
