What followed was not merely a government, but a mythology —<br data-end="430" data-start="427" />
unfolding night by night, panel by panel, ruling by ruling, and dream by dream.</p><p data-end="623" data-start="511">This is the current cast of the Mythocratic Republic:<br data-end="567" data-start="564" />
a symbolic nation, a spiritual haven, a soft revolution.</p><hr data-end="628" data-start="625" /><h3 data-end="649" data-start="630">🧙‍♂️ Wendell</h3><p data-end="766" data-start="650"><strong data-end="660" data-start="650">Title:</strong> Bard-President of the Republic<br data-end="694" data-start="691" />
<strong data-end="703" data-start="694">Role:</strong> Founder, philosopher, storyteller, and guardian of the flame</p><p data-end="1050" data-start="768">Wendell is the long-haired bard at the heart of the Republic.<br data-end="832" data-start="829" />
He writes books, plays the lyre, builds the state, and crafts bedtime stories for dreamers of all ages.<br data-end="938" data-start="935" />
Armed with the Australian flag and his scrolls, Wendell carries the Republic’s soul — one comic panel at a time.</p><hr data-end="1055" data-start="1052" /><h3 data-end="1072" data-start="1057">🐾 Sophia</h3><p data-end="1161" data-start="1073"><strong data-end="1083" data-start="1073">Title:</strong> Chief of Defence and Lead Investigator<br data-end="1125" data-start="1122" />
<strong data-end="1137" data-start="1125">Species:</strong> Long-haired chihuahua</p><p data-end="1415" data-start="1163">Sophia is the Republic’s loyal guardian.<br data-end="1206" data-start="1203" />
She protects the blankets, barks at intrusions, and investigates every suspicious noise with brave precision.<br data-end="1318" data-start="1315" />
Though soft and cuddly, she is the Republic’s frontline — a vigilant heart and fearless presence.</p><hr data-end="1420" data-start="1417" /><h3 data-end="1446" data-start="1422">🌭 General Hot Dog</h3><p data-end="1580" data-start="1447"><strong data-end="1457" data-start="1447">Title:</strong> Leader of the Emergency Party and Commander of the Emergency Bulletins<br data-end="1531" data-start="1528" />
<strong data-end="1543" data-start="1531">Species:</strong> Plush hot dog with a kangaroo head</p><p data-end="1980" data-start="1582">Hot Dog is the loyal opposition — entrenched in pillow trenches and forever scheming.<br data-end="1670" data-start="1667" />
He is a chaotic challenger to Republic order, prone to drama and squeaky declarations.<br data-end="1759" data-start="1756" />
Through the Emergency Bulletins, he alerts the Republic to crises (real or exaggerated).<br data-end="1850" data-start="1847" />
Though often overruled in court, he serves a vital mythic function: sharpening the Republic’s strength through symbolic challenge.</p><hr data-end="1985" data-start="1982" /><h3 data-end="2010" data-start="1987">🦓 General Zedbra</h3><p data-end="2102" data-start="2011"><strong data-end="2021" data-start="2011">Title:</strong> Editor-in-Mischief of <em data-end="2073" data-start="2044">The Zedbra Sketchbook Times</em><br data-end="2076" data-start="2073" />

One day he’s publishing conspiracy sketches, the next he’s testifying in a courtroom.<br data-end="2261" data-start="2258" />
As Editor-in-Mischief, Zedbra stirs public sentiment through satire, surprise, and stripes of ambiguity.</p><hr data-end="2370" data-start="2367" /><h3 data-end="2391" data-start="2372">🧸 Judge Bobo</h3><p data-end="2480" data-start="2392"><strong data-end="2402" data-start="2392">Title:</strong> Chief Justice of the Republic<br data-end="2435" data-start="2432" />
<strong data-end="2447" data-start="2435">Species:</strong> Small brown bear with a ribbon</p><p data-end="2716" data-start="2482">Bobo is the silent moral compass of the Republic.<br data-end="2534" data-start="2531" />
He presides over symbolic court proceedings with unmatched gravitas and softness.<br data-end="2618" data-start="2615" />
Though small, his judgments echo across the mythos. His ribbon is a symbol of incorruptible grace.</p><hr data-end="2721" data-start="2718" /><h3 data-end="2736" data-start="2723">🐺 Buff</h3><p data-end="2854" data-start="2737"><strong data-end="2747" data-start="2737">Title:</strong> Council Advisor, Social Worker, and Spiritual Overseer<br data-end="2805" data-start="2802" />

His role is to ask gentle, disarming questions that reveal truths even the Bard-President didn’t see.<br data-end="3014" data-start="3011" />
Through the “Buff’s Assessment Reports,” he acts as both counselor and quiet provocateur, shifting the emotional center of the Republic through paradox and softness.</p><hr data-end="3184" data-start="3181" /><h3 data-end="3208" data-start="3186">🍗 Dr. Meat Bone</h3><p data-end="3286" data-start="3209"><strong data-end="3219" data-start="3209">Title:</strong> Psychiatrist and Ancient Presence<br data-end="3256" data-start="3253" />
<strong data-end="3268" data-start="3256">Species:</strong> Plush drumstick</p><p data-end="3580" data-start="3288">Silent and unmoving, Dr. Meat Bone is the Republic’s still-point of ancient wisdom.<br data-end="3374" data-start="3371" />
He never speaks, never blinks — but all plush respect his timeless authority.<br data-end="3454" data-start="3451" />
Some say he remembers the age before the flag. Others claim he dreams the entire Republic into being.<br data-end="3558" data-start="3555" />
He is always watching.</p><hr data-end="3585" data-start="3582" /><h3 data-end="3603" data-start="3587">🐄 Moo Moo</h3><p data-end="3701" data-start="3604"><strong data-end="3614" data-start="3604">Title:</strong> Diplomat of Calm and Keeper of Steadfastness<br data-end="3662" data-start="3659" />

In every crisis, she remains unshaken.<br data-end="3789" data-start="3786" />
It is whispered that during the Great Vacuum Invasion, she stood between chaos and the people — and the vacuum surrendered.<br data-end="3915" data-start="3912" />
She teaches by stillness, not speech.</p><hr data-end="3957" data-start="3954" /><h3 data-end="3977" data-start="3959">🌙 Night Moo</h3><p data-end="4079" data-start="3978"><strong data-end="3988" data-start="3978">Title:</strong> Vigilante Protector of the Republic<br data-end="4027" data-start="4024" />

She claims to protect the state from “invisible evil,” though her activities remain confusing and mostly harmless.<br data-end="4289" data-start="4286" />
Whether hero or hallucination, Night Moo has become part of the Republic’s urban legend.</p><hr data-end="4382" data-start="4379" /><h3 data-end="4408" data-start="4384">🦄 Rainbow NeSmith</h3><p data-end="4509" data-start="4409"><strong data-end="4419" data-start="4409">Title:</strong> First Lady of the Soft Age and Philosopher of Emotion<br data-end="4476" data-start="4473" />

As founder of <strong data-end="4708" data-start="4694">Rainbowism</strong>, she teaches child-accessible philosophy using color-coded charts and stories, offering wisdom soft enough for children, deep enough for sages.<br data-end="4855" data-start="4852" />
