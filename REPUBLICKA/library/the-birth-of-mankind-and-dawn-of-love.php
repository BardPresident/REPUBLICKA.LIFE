My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>In the ancient tales woven by our ancestors, there is a story of creation that mirrors our own journey, a journey where gods, wisdom, and love intertwine to shape the world and our very existence. </div><div><br></div><div>It begins with Zeus, the mighty ruler of the gods, instructing the Titan Prometheus to fashion mankind from clay. Prometheus, with his deft hands and vision, molded humanity from the earth, crafting us with care and intention. But it was the breath of Athena, the goddess of wisdom, that animated these figures, infusing them with life and intellect. This breath was not merely air but a spark of wisdom, the same wisdom I see in you, Ivory, the one who inspires and breathes life into my dreams and aspirations.</div><div><br></div><div>Prometheus, always the benefactor of humanity, saw the potential for more. He stole fire from the heavens—a fire that today symbolizes the Internet, the very medium through which I reach out to you. This fire, this gift of knowledge and connection, allowed mankind to flourish, to build civilizations, and to reach beyond the mundane. Yet, in this golden age, men lived in a world absent of women, ignorant of the fullness of love and partnership. It was a time of potential but also of profound loneliness, much like my own life before I began my quest to find you, my dearest Ivory.</div><div><br></div><div>To bridge this gap, the gods created Pandora, the first woman, crafted by all the deities to bring beauty, curiosity, and a touch of divine complexity into the world. With her arrival, mankind could now truly thrive, for she brought with her the capacity for love, the promise of companionship, and the means to repopulate and ensure the continuity of humanity. But Pandora also carried with her a jar, which, when opened, released all the ills of our species. This duality of bringing both hope and hardship is a reminder of the complexities of life and love.</div><div><br></div><div>In the aftermath, humanity had to rebuild, starting from the beginning but this time, without the direct intervention of the gods. We turned to each other, finding strength and resilience in our shared struggles. Deucalion and Pyrrha, the lone survivors of the great flood, were instructed to throw the bones of their mother over their shoulders to repopulate the earth. They realized that these bones were the stones of the earth, their mother. And from these stones, new life sprang forth.</div><div><br></div><div>Today, I see the Internet as our great mother, a vast repository of knowledge and potential. The stones we cast are the digital pieces of information, the videos, and the messages I create and distribute. Each piece is an effort to connect, to share wisdom, to inspire, and to find you, my beloved Ivory.</div><div><br></div><div>In these myths, I find echoes of my own story. Like Prometheus, I seek to bring light and connection to a world that can often feel lonely and disconnected. Like Pandora, I understand that with the gifts we bring to each other, there may come challenges, but also the promise of deeper understanding and love. And like Deucalion and Pyrrha, I believe in starting anew, in the power of small acts—each video, each message—as a stone cast behind me, bringing us closer to a future filled with promise.</div><div><br></div><div>These stories remind us that wisdom, love, and resilience are intertwined, that we must embrace both the fire of knowledge and the companionship of love to truly flourish. As I continue to reach out to you, I hold these lessons close, believing that each step we take, each stone we cast, brings us closer to a world where we can thrive together.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and hope,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
