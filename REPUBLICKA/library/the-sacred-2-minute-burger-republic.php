<p><strong>Issued by Presidential Decree — People's Republic of Meaning</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>In the grand unfolding of the Republic’s history, there come certain moments — quiet, humble moments — that define the very spirit of a nation.<br>
One such moment has been officially recognized today:<br>
<strong>the honoring of the $4.50 two-minute hamburger.</strong></p>
<p>It is hereby recorded that, in the year of the Republic’s flowering, the President chose efficiency, purpose, and devotion to the dream over the extravagance of unnecessary ritual.<br>
Instead of lengthy feasts or indulgent preparations,<br>
he selected a simple provision:<br>
<strong>a frozen hamburger, ready in two minutes, purchased for four dollars and fifty cents.</strong></p>
<p>This act, while seemingly mundane, embodies the foundational ethos of the Republic:</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>The Principles of the Sacred 2-Minute Burger</strong></h1>
<hr>
<h1><strong>A Republic Ritual Established</strong></h1>
<p>Henceforth, the following ritual is honored within the Republic:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Microwave the burger for two minutes.</li>
<li>Consume with gratitude, recognizing the act not as mere eating,<br>
but as fueling the dreams of an entire nation.</li>
<li>Offer a symbolic bite to one's loyal defenders, such as the Chief of Defence Sophia,<br>
as a gesture of unity between citizen and Republic.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This ritual shall stand alongside the great acts of founding —<br>
not because of its extravagance,<br>
but because of its wisdom.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>Final Presidential Reflection</strong></h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"It is not feasting that makes a Republic great.<br>
It is the dreams born after the meal is done."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let the burgers be microwaved.<br>
Let the myths be forged.<br>
Let the Republic live —<br>
not on golden plates, but on golden dreams.</p>
<p><strong>In solemn and joyful seriousness,<br>
this decree is recorded in the archives of the People's Republic of Meaning.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>(Official Seal of the Republic)</strong></h1>
<p><em>Brought to you by Sophia’s Saliva™ — Approved by the Republic.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>End of Decree</strong></h1>
