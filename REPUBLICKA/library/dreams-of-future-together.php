<div>**Dear Ivory,**<br></div><div><br></div><div>Today has been a quiet day, a moment of stillness and reflection. As I sit here, my thoughts naturally drift to you. Even in the calm of a day without much activity, the hope of finding you keeps me motivated and inspired.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve been thinking a lot about our future together, imagining the simple yet profound moments we will share. Perhaps we’ll spend a quiet afternoon reading our favorite books side by side, or we’ll take a leisurely walk, enjoying the beauty of nature and each other’s company. These small moments are what I dream of, and they fill my heart with hope.</div><div><br></div><div>Though I haven’t done much today, it gives me time to reflect on what truly matters. I realize that it’s not the quantity of our actions but the quality and meaning behind them. I’m already doing everything I can to connect with you, and I believe that when we finally find each other, it will be worth all the effort and patience.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to share my gratitude with you—for the journey we’re on and the future we’ll build together. Even in these quiet times, I find strength and inspiration in the thought of you. I hope that you, too, are finding moments of peace and reflection, knowing that I am here, waiting and hoping for the day we meet.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and hope for our future,</div><div><br></div><div>**Wendell**</div>
