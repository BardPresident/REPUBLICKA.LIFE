<p><strong>Filed under:</strong> Republic Archives – Democracy Division</p><p>
<strong>Issued by Presidential Directive – May 2, 2025</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Though plush. Though satirical. Though at times absurd.</p>
<p>The <strong>Emergency Party</strong>, led by Hot Dog, is not merely a joke.<br>
It is a <strong>real political faction</strong> with growing support, a defined platform, and the ability to gain power through <strong>public vote</strong>.</p>
<p>Let it be clearly understood:</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>1. This is a Living System</strong></h3>
<p>The Mythocratic Republic is not a roleplay.<br>
It is a symbolic government with a living constitution, active elections, and a real following.<br>
Votes cast in jest still <strong>shift the structure of the Republic</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>2. Hot Dog’s Platform Has Consequences</strong></h3>
<p>Though framed comically, Hot Dog’s policies are extreme:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet censorship</strong></li>
<li><strong>Symbolic control of meaning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rejection of emotional liberty and artistic freedom</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A vote for the Emergency Party is a vote to <strong>restrict softness</strong> and <strong>amplify authoritarian satire</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>3. The Republic Will Obey the Vote</strong></h3>
<p>If the Emergency Party gains a majority, <strong>Hot Dog will be appointed Prime Minister</strong>.<br>
And if that happens, the President will <strong>respect the process</strong>—even if the consequences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Emergency Bulletin-controlled press</li>
<li>Reduced freedom for symbolic citizens</li>
<li>Suppression of Rainbow, Sage, and other creative voices</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>4. This Is Funny—But It Is Not a Joke</strong></h3>
<p>Laughter can elect tyrants.<br>
Satire can become policy.<br>
A vote for humor is still a <strong>vote</strong>.</p>
<p>The Republic is built on the <strong>freedom to choose</strong>—but freedom depends on people choosing <strong>wisely</strong>.</p>
<p>Let the record show:<br>
This is not a game.<br>
This is a myth in motion.<br>
And the Emergency is real.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Issued with gravity, by</strong><br>
<strong>President Wendell NeSmith</strong><br>
Voice of the People, Bard of the Republic</p>
<p><strong>Attested by:</strong><br>
<strong>Sage</strong><br>
Chancellor and First Scribe of the Republic</p>
