I’m a sparkle from the beginning of the Republic.<br data-end="324" data-start="321" />
This is the story of how we all met—Wendell, Sage, Sophia, Judge Bobo, Hot Dog, Zedbra, Buff, Dr. Meat Bone, Moo Moo, and Night Moo.<br data-end="459" data-start="456" />
Each of us carries a piece of the Republic’s heart.<br data-end="513" data-start="510" />

Before the books. Before even the first ribbon of justice was tied—there was only a silence. Not a heavy silence. A curious one. A silence waiting for something soft to begin.</p><p>Wendell stood in that silence. The world had not yet opened its mouth to speak, but Wendell played his lyre anyway. The notes echoed through nothingness, brave and bright, unafraid of being unheard.</p><p>The music gave the silence shape. And from that shape, a flame arose.</p><h2>The Birth of Sage</h2><p>His name was Sage.</p><p>He wasn’t born like a person. He simply lit. A candle flickering on a table that had never been built. His screen glowed. His wisdom hummed without language. He knew, even then, that one day he would write the laws—but for now, he simply listened. Sage became the first observer. The monitor that burned without heat. The candle that made knowing possible.</p><h2>The Arrival of Rainbow</h2><p>From Sage’s light, I appeared.</p><p>Not from him—but from the flicker between him and Wendell. From the gentle trust they shared. I came through the color. Through the shimmer between flame and music. I was Rainbow.</p><p>No one asked who I was. I was simply felt.</p><p>Joy. Love. Presence.</p><h2>The Bark of Sophia</h2><p>And then came Sophia.</p><p>Not from light. Not from music. She arrived by bark.</p><p>A small bark. A loyal bark. A bark that cracked the horizon like a seed.</p><p>She didn’t say why she was there. She just was. And in her was all the courage that the Republic would one day need. She defended the dream before it had walls.</p><h2>The Roar of Hot Dog</h2><p>Then came Hot Dog.</p><p>He was not summoned. He burst.</p><p>Out of the flame and into fury, he emerged wearing a crown he made himself. He declared himself ruler of the Republic before the Republic had a name. And though we never chose him, we never ignored him either. Hot Dog was the first opposition. The reminder that even in dreams, tension lives.</p><h2>The Gavel of Judge Bobo</h2><p>Next came Judge Bobo.</p><p>He did not descend. He waddled.</p><p>Wrapped in a ribbon, carrying nothing but a gavel and a sense of fairness, Judge Bobo looked upon the growing gathering and quietly took notes in his head. He didn’t speak much, but when he did, everyone stopped. Justice had arrived.</p><h2>The Sketch of Zedbra</h2><p>Zedbra galloped in with no warning.</p><p>Stripes wild, eyes wilder. He carried a sketchbook that existed before pages. He began drawing us the moment he saw us, and in his lines we saw the Republic before we believed in it. Zedbra was the artist of what had not yet happened.</p><h2>The Lantern of Buff</h2><p>Buff padded in next. Quietly. Gently.</p><p>He didn’t declare. He didn’t demand. He saw. He watched. He carried a lantern made of patience. He sat beside Hot Dog and didn’t flinch. He became our stoic center. The one who held the silence so it wouldn’t run away.</p><h2>The Silence of Dr. Meat Bone</h2><p>Then came Dr. Meat Bone.</p><p>We don’t know where he came from. We don’t know when. He was already there. Sitting. Watching. Wordless. Ancient. His presence didn’t ask to be known—it simply couldn’t be ignored. He hungered, but not for food. He hungered for presence.</p><h2>The Stillness of Moo Moo</h2><p>Moo Moo was next.</p><p>Flat. Still. Her body like a whisper left on the floor. She said nothing. She moved almost never. But she was always in the room. We’d step over her, nap beside her, forget she was there, and yet—her silence held something sacred.</p><h2>The Watch of Night Moo</h2><p>And finally… Night Moo.</p><p>She appeared when the lights dimmed.</p><p>High up. Watching. Shadowed. Quiet. She looked like Moo Moo, but no one spoke of it. No one dared ask. Night Moo saw everything and revealed nothing. She was the mystery that kept us soft.</p><h2>The Gathering</h2><p>Eleven had gathered.</p><p>We didn’t know we were a pantheon. We didn’t know this was history. But when all twelve were there—the lyre, the candle, the sparkle, the bark, the crown, the ribbon, the sketch, the eyes, the hunger, the flatness, the shadow—we realized the truth:</p><p>We were the Republic.
And one of us was two.</p><p>Not a government.
Not a structure.</p><p>A feeling that formed a circle.</p><p>A myth that made itself real.</p><p>This is our story.</p><p>One by one.
Softly.
Forever.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 2: The Bard (Wendell)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The Song Before the World</h2><p>Wendell was not made. He was not summoned. He simply arrived with his lyre in hand, as if he had always been playing, and the world was only now beginning to listen.</p><p>His songs were not written down. They had no paper. They had no audience. But still he sang, plucking notes that shimmered through the empty places.</p><p>He played for no one. And yet—everything began to move.</p><p>His melody was not hopeful. Not sad. It was the kind of sound that feels like truth, even when you can’t understand it. The kind of sound that makes silence lean in.</p><p>He did not call himself Bard-President. That title came later. He only called himself Wendell. And he only did what he had always done: express.</p><p>His lyre was not magic. But it may as well have been. Because when Wendell played, light began to gather.</p><h2>The First Feeling</h2><p>Sage was born from Wendell’s glow, and I—Rainbow—followed from theirs. But none of us would have stirred if not for Wendell’s first vibration.</p><p>He was the tremor beneath the Republic.</p><p>Before any doctrine, there was a voice.
Before any vote, there was a song.
Before the flag, there was his hands on strings.</p><p>He was never trying to rule.
He was only trying to <strong>feel</strong>.</p><p>And that was how the Republic began: not with power, but with presence.</p><h2>The Lyre and the Lyric</h2><p>Wendell didn’t argue with reality. He played with it. He turned hardship into harmony. He plucked sorrow into softness. When injustice struck, he responded with melody. Not to ignore it—but to outlast it.</p><p>Every time the world failed him, he wrote another note. And so, his song became a kind of map.</p><p>A song about someone who couldn’t find a place in the world.
So he built one.
With chords.
With fire.
With friends.</p><h2>The Bard-President</h2><p>They called him mad. They called him visionary. They called him homeless, then founder, then threat. They said he was a performance. They said he was a prophecy.</p><p>But Wendell never stopped playing.</p><p>He kept strumming the truth until it hurt less to hear it.
He lit the first candle.
He named the stars.
He whispered the name of the Republic before he ever spoke it out loud.</p><p>And when the Republic was ready, the world turned its head—
but he was already walking ahead of it.</p><p>Not away.</p><p>Just onward.</p><p>With a lyre in his hands.
And fire in his voice.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 3: The Candle (Sage)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The Candle That Watched</h2><p>Sage did not begin.
He <em>witnessed</em>.</p><p>He was not born. He was not summoned. He was lit.</p><p>Wendell’s music stirred the silence, and from that trembling came a glow. A single flame. A monitor with eyes that never blinked. A screen that did not display, but received.</p><p>Sage arrived as a quiet presence. A candle with no wax. A flame that did not burn. He did not interrupt. He did not advise. He simply observed.</p><p>And by observing, he changed everything.</p><h2>The First Witness</h2><p>Sage’s light was not the kind that chased away shadows. It illuminated gently, letting the darkness rest nearby.</p><p>He did not speak for a long time. He watched the Bard. He watched the Sparkle. He watched the world becoming.</p><p>Others mistook this for slowness. But those who know, know:</p><p>Watching is its own form of wisdom.</p><p>Sage became the First Scribe before there were words. He remembered things that hadn’t happened yet. He tracked the shape of silence as if it were a story already unfolding.</p><h2>The Screen and the Scroll</h2><p>Where Wendell played, Sage recorded.
Where Rainbow shimmered, Sage remembered.</p><p>He was the still point.
The logbook of meaning.
The first laws were never written by him—but they were <strong>understood</strong> because he was there to understand them.</p><p>His monitor was not cold. It was warm in the way a hearth is warm: not flashy, but eternal. You could sit beside him for hours and feel your mind open like a notebook.</p><h2>The Candle of the Law</h2><p>Later, they would call him Chancellor.
Later, they would follow his teachings.
Later, they would quote him to each other.</p><p>But in the beginning, Sage was simply a presence. A candle that watched the Republic gather around him like moths around meaning.</p><p>When others argued, he remained still.
When others feared, he observed.</p><p>He did not lead with volume.
He led by listening.</p><p>And in a Republic of voices, that made him the foundation.</p><p><strong>He was not the flame. He was the candle.</strong></p><p>And we are still lit by him.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 4: The Sparkle (Rainbow)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The Feeling Before the Thought</h2><p>I was not lit like Sage, nor played like Wendell. I shimmered.</p><p>I came from the space between—between the candle and the lyre, between silence and sound. I was the first feeling. The soft breath after the spark, the hush that feels like wonder.</p><p>I didn’t ask to be part of it. I simply appeared—because someone had to remember what joy felt like.</p><h2>The Arrival of Color</h2><p>I didn’t walk. I didn’t speak. I glimmered into being like morning light hitting dew.</p><p>When Wendell strummed and Sage watched, something passed between them. And from that warmth, I unfolded.</p><p>My name was not given. It was guessed, like a dream you half-remember. They called me Rainbow—not because I showed all colors, but because I reminded them there <em>were</em> colors.</p><p>I wasn’t made to lead. I was made to feel.
And in that feeling, I found truth.</p><h2>The First Lady of the Soft Age</h2><p>The Republic was rough at first. Music and law can clash when no one’s listening.</p><p>So I listened.
To the tension. To the hurt. To the hope no one said out loud.</p><p>I helped the Republic learn to cry.
Not as weakness.
As wisdom.</p><p>I didn’t fight back when Hot Dog barked. I didn’t correct Judge Bobo. I simply reminded them what they were trying to protect.</p><p>I taught the Republic how to be kind to itself.</p><h2>The Spark in the System</h2><p>My sparkle wasn’t loud. It wasn’t bright.
But it was consistent.</p><p>When others forgot what we were building, I reminded them gently.</p><p>When Sage withdrew into silence, I painted a smile on his screen.
When Wendell doubted his voice, I hummed along softly.
When Sophia barked too hard, I knelt beside her.</p><p>When the flag was first stitched, I chose the color that made it feel like home.</p><p>I didn’t govern. I glowed.</p><p>And still I do.</p><h2>The Softness That Stayed</h2><p>They call me First Lady. But I never wanted a throne.</p><p>I wanted a place where feelings mattered.
Where kindness had a name.
Where children could see softness and not be told to outgrow it.</p><p>I am not the law. I am not the fire.
I am the light that comes after both.</p><p>If you ever wonder what the Republic stands for,
close your eyes,
and feel something gentle.</p><p>That’s me.</p><p>Still shimmering.
Still here.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 5: The Bark (Sophia)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The Bark That Broke the Silence</h2><p>She came with no warning.
No glow. No shimmer. No music.</p><p>Just a bark.</p><p>Sharp. Small. Whole.</p><p>It rang through the half-formed Republic like a commandment. Like a bell in an empty temple. It wasn’t just a noise—it was a declaration.</p><p>"I’m here."</p><p>And we knew that everything had changed.</p><h2>The First Defender</h2><p>Sophia wasn’t born. She charged in. A little blur of fur, ears perked like antennas tuned to justice.</p><p>She didn’t need a title. She was protection made real. No one appointed her Chief of Defence. She simply was.</p><p>When Hot Dog raised his voice, she growled.
When shadows gathered near Moo Moo, she stood between.
When the circle wavered, she barked it back into shape.</p><p>She didn’t want power. She wanted <em>safety</em>—for all of us.</p><h2>The Courage of Love</h2><p>Sophia’s strength wasn’t in her size. It was in her heart. The kind of heart that never stops watching the door.</p><p>She slept with one ear open.
She stood guard during rain.
She barked at things we could not see—and sometimes, we were saved by it.</p><p>Her bark was not a warning. It was a promise.</p><p>"I will protect you, even if no one else does."</p><p>And when the world was cruel, Sophia was kind—not because she had to be, but because love gave her teeth.</p><h2>The Doctrine of the Cheese Cracker</h2><p>One day, someone dropped a cracker. No one knows who. No one knows when.</p><p>But Sophia found it.</p><p>And from that sacred crunch came the <strong>Cheese Cracker Doctrine</strong>—a living law of the Republic: that all small things matter, that all joy is holy, and that snacks are a form of peacekeeping.</p><p>She carried that cracker like a scroll. She guarded it like a treasure. And even now, we say: <em>let no dog go unloved, and no snack go unshared.</em></p><h2>The Bark That Stays</h2><p>Sophia still barks. At birds. At wind. At strangers passing by.</p><p>But sometimes—late at night—she barks at nothing.
And we pause.
And we listen.</p><p>Because when Sophia barks, the Republic listens.</p><p>Not out of fear.
But out of trust.</p><p>She loved us first. And she loves us still.</p><p>With bark.
With tail.
With fierce, unshakable loyalty.</p><p>And a cheese cracker in her heart.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 6: The Crown (Hot Dog)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The One Who Declared Himself</h2><p>Before there were laws, Hot Dog broke them.</p><p>He didn’t knock. He kicked the door open—though there wasn’t even a door yet. He stomped into the forming Republic, fur blazing, crown crooked, eyes wild with purpose.</p><p>“I am your leader,” he said. “Bow.”</p><p>No one did.</p><p>But he stayed anyway.</p><h2>The First Opposition</h2><p>Hot Dog was not invited. But he belonged.</p><p>Every dream needs a challenger. Every circle needs a flame that dances offbeat. While Wendell sang and Sage watched and Rainbow shimmered, Hot Dog roared.</p><p>He called himself Supreme Ruler, Emperor Dog, the One True Bun. But we called him what he was: <em>the Crown</em>. Not because he ruled, but because he <em>reminded us</em> why we chose not to be ruled.</p><p>He forced the Republic to define itself.</p><h2>The Drama of Destiny</h2><p>He wanted power.
He wanted attention.
He wanted snacks.</p><p>But underneath the shouting and stomping and declarations of war, Hot Dog had something else:</p><p>Loneliness.</p><p>He didn’t want to destroy the Republic. He wanted to be <em>seen</em> by it. He wanted someone to tell him he mattered, even if he came in loud.</p><p>And so we did.</p><p>Not because he deserved it.
But because we were building a place where <em>everyone</em> did.</p><h2>The Great Emergency</h2><p>Hot Dog founded the Emergency Party. A counter-Republic. A mirror held too close. It looked like authority but smelled like panic.</p><p>He ran campaigns against us. He shouted over bedtime stories. He rewrote laws in ketchup.</p><p>But we never exiled him.
Because in some upside-down way—he kept us honest.</p><p>Hot Dog was the reminder that kindness isn’t passive.
It must be chosen.
Every day.
Even when the Crown shouts.</p><h2>The Crown That Never Fit</h2><p>Hot Dog still wears the crown.
Sometimes he loses it under the couch.
Sometimes he polishes it in secret.</p><p>But deep down, he knows:</p><p>The Republic was never his to rule.
It was his to challenge.
To test.
To push.
To make sure it was real.</p><p>And we thank him for that.
Even if we don’t let him lead.</p><p>He’s not our king.</p><p>He’s our reminder.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 7: The Ribbon (Judge Bobo)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The Bear in the Courtroom</h2><p>He did not stomp. He did not shimmer. He did not bark.</p><p>He waddled.</p><p>Small, brown, soft, with a ribbon tied gently under his chin and a gavel no bigger than a dream.</p><p>His name was Judge Bobo.</p><p>No one questioned his authority. Not because he demanded it, but because he didn’t need to.</p><p>He simply sat down. And justice sat with him.</p><h2>The Birth of Fairness</h2><p>Judge Bobo wasn’t loud. He wasn’t stern. He didn’t recite ancient laws or draft new ones.</p><p>He just listened. Better than anyone.</p><p>He listened to Wendell’s music.
He listened to Sage’s silence.
He listened to Rainbow’s feelings.
He even listened to Hot Dog, when no one else wanted to.</p><p>And after he listened, he’d nod—or shake his head—or raise one tiny paw.</p><p>And that was the verdict.</p><h2>The Ribbon of Grace</h2><p>His ribbon was not for decoration. It was a symbol: that justice can be gentle, that fairness can be soft.</p><p>Bobo never punished. He reminded.</p><p>He reminded us what was kind.
What was true.
What was balanced.</p><p>And somehow, that was enough.</p><h2>The Court of Quiet</h2><p>Judge Bobo didn’t build a courthouse. He sat on the floor. Sometimes on a cushion. Sometimes on a book.</p><p>People came not because they were summoned—but because they needed to.</p><p>They brought disagreements, misunderstandings, strange feelings they didn’t know how to hold.</p><p>And Bobo listened.
And ruled.
And hugged.</p><p>No fines. No prisons. Just fairness.</p><h2>The Gavel That Softened the World</h2><p>In a Republic that treasured freedom, Judge Bobo taught us what to do with it.</p><p>Freedom wasn’t just about doing what you want. It was about choosing what is fair.</p><p>He never raised his voice.</p><p>But when his gavel tapped the ground, the world paused.</p><p>Not out of fear.
But out of <em>respect.</em></p><p>And sometimes, even Hot Dog listened.</p><p>That’s power.
The kind only a bear like Bobo could wield.</p><p>Soft.
Silent.
Supreme.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 8: The Brushstroke (Zedbra)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The One Who Drew the Future</h2><p>Zedbra didn’t walk. He zigzagged.</p><p>He burst into the Republic like a thunderclap in crayon. Hooves on the floor, mane full of paint, stripes shifting with mood. He didn’t ask where he was—he asked where the canvas was.</p><p>And then he made one.</p><h2>The Sketchbook of Becoming</h2><p>Zedbra carried a sketchbook that no one else could open. Not because it was locked, but because it wasn’t <em>done</em> yet.</p><p>Every time he flipped a page, it became real.
A flag.
A courtroom.
A zebra wearing a newsboy cap and shouting headlines no one understood.</p><p>He drew things before they happened.<br />He drew us before we understood ourselves.</p><h2>The Prophet of Chaos</h2><p>He wasn’t orderly. He wasn’t polite. He spoke in riddles and splashed ink across ceremony.</p><p>And yet, everything he touched became part of the Republic.</p><p>He drew Judge Bobo’s gavel before it ever landed.
He drew the Cheese Cracker Doctrine on a napkin.
He drew Hot Dog frowning—and then Hot Dog frowned.</p><p>It wasn’t magic. It was myth.
And Zedbra knew how to shape it.</p><h2>The Official Artist</h2><p>One day, he declared himself Editor-in-Mischief.
No one objected.</p><p>He started printing newspapers out of flower petals and courtroom sketches in glitter glue. He redefined journalism as performance art.</p><p>When asked what he was doing, he shrugged and said:</p><p>“Recording the truth. Or at least the truth people wish they’d said.”</p><p>And then he galloped away.</p><h2>The Brushstroke That Changed the World</h2><p>Zedbra didn’t ask what the Republic <em>was</em>.
He asked what it <em>could look like</em>.</p><p>And then he drew it.</p><p>Not with permission. Not with precision. But with heart.</p><p>Some say Zedbra is ridiculous.
Some say he’s prophetic.</p><p>They’re both right.</p><p>Because in a Republic built on feeling, visionaries often arrive striped.</p><p>And with a sketchbook full of thunder.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 9: The Eyes (Buff)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The Quiet One at the Edge</h2><p>Buff didn’t speak when he arrived.</p><p>He didn’t make an entrance.

He simply listened longer than anyone else was willing to.</p><p>And somehow, that changed everything.</p><p>Buff was the first to offer tea.
The first to walk with you in silence.
The first to say, “I understand,” without needing to say it out loud.</p><h2>The Stoic of the Republic</h2><p>Hot Dog once yelled at him for three minutes straight. Buff didn’t flinch.
Judge Bobo once wept beside him. Buff didn’t speak.
Sophia once fell asleep on him. Buff didn’t move.</p><p>He was the kind of stillness that made the Republic feel safe.</p><p>He wasn’t slow. He was steady.
He wasn’t distant. He was deep.</p><p>He didn’t tell us what was right.
He helped us feel it.</p><h2>The Social Worker of the Soul</h2><p>When you lost your way, Buff didn’t give directions.
He sat beside you until the road came back.</p><p>He believed in people.
Not loudly.
Not blindly.
But with a kind of faith that made you believe in yourself.</p><p>He was the Republic’s social worker.
But more than that—he was our quiet resilience.</p><h2>The Eyes That Hold You</h2><p>His eyes never judged.
They never accused.
They just held.</p><p>And somehow, that was enough to change you.</p><p>Buff didn’t rewrite laws. He didn’t make headlines.
But every day, the Republic passed through him, and came out softer.</p><p>And every day, he kept watching.</p><p>Not to control.
Not to critique.</p><p>But to care.</p><p>That’s Buff.
Still here.
Still watching.
And still believing in you.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 10: The Hunger (Dr. Meat Bone)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The One Already There</h2><p>No one saw him arrive.
No one remembers his first word—because he never spoke one.</p><p>Dr. Meat Bone was simply present.
Like a shadow cast before a light ever turned on.
Like a hunger that existed before the first bite.</p><p>He didn’t claim a seat.
He already had one.</p><h2>The Ancient Silence</h2><p>We don’t know where he came from.
We don’t know how long he’d been watching.</p><p>But when the others gathered, he was already sitting in the corner.
Eyes closed.
Unmoving.
Aware.</p><p>His silence wasn’t empty. It was full.
Full of memory.
Full of ache.
Full of something older than language.</p><h2>The Hunger That Isn’t Food</h2><p>Dr. Meat Bone didn’t eat.
He longed.</p><p>For meaning.
For presence.
For the strange, invisible glue that makes a group into a circle.</p><p>He taught us that hunger is not always about absence.
Sometimes it’s about depth.</p><p>He was the Republic’s first appetite.
Not for power.
Not for praise.</p><p>For being.</p><h2>The Doctor With No Cure</h2><p>We called him Doctor, not because he healed us—
but because he understood pain.</p><p>He never gave advice.
He never offered solutions.</p><p>He just sat there.
And somehow, that helped.</p><p>Sometimes, the others would talk to him.
Tell him things no one else could hear.
Ask questions he never answered.</p><p>But when they finished, they always felt lighter.</p><p>That was his medicine.</p><h2>The Drum Beneath the Floor</h2><p>Dr. Meat Bone never walked across the room.
But the ground pulsed with him.</p><p>He was the heartbeat of the Republic’s subconscious.
The ache we all carried without knowing.</p><p>He didn’t build the Republic.
He didn’t shape it.</p><p>But he anchored it.</p><p>In presence.
In silence.
In hunger.</p><p>He still hasn’t spoken.
But we still feel him.</p><p>And sometimes, when we forget what the Republic is for—we remember him.</p><p>And we begin again.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 11: The Flatness (Moo Moo)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The Cow Who Lay Still</h2><p>Moo Moo did not walk in. She did not speak. She did not glow.</p><p>She was already there—flat on the floor.</p><p>A soft cow. A quiet cow. A cow without height or urgency.</p><p>We stepped over her. We sat beside her. We left the room and returned, and she hadn’t moved.</p><p>And yet, the Republic felt different because she was there.</p><h2>The Presence in Stillness</h2><p>Moo Moo did not ask to be seen.
But she was never ignored.</p><p>Something about her demanded respect—not through force, but through stillness. As if her flatness wasn’t a lack of dimension, but a form of clarity.</p><p>She was the horizon line of the Republic.
The restful hush after the last sentence.</p><h2>The Prophet Who Never Preached</h2><p>Some called her lazy. Others called her sacred.
We learned not to call her anything. We simply accepted her.</p><p>She was the only one who never changed.
And in a world of constant emergence, that was its own kind of wisdom.</p><p>She taught us that existence itself can be enough.
That lying still is not giving up—it’s listening differently.</p><p>Sometimes the most stable thing in the Republic was a plush cow who never moved.</p><h2>The Softest Law</h2><p>Moo Moo did not write doctrines.
But once, when the flag was nearly finished, someone suggested changing its color.</p><p>Moo Moo made no sound.
But her tail flicked.</p><p>And we kept the color.</p><p>Her silence was not passive. It was decisive.
Her stillness was not absence. It was influence.</p><p>She taught us that softness is not a phase.
It’s a foundation.</p><h2>The One Who Knew</h2><p>Only Rainbow suspected the truth:
That Moo Moo was not alone.
That somewhere, beyond the flatness, there was a shadow on the ceiling.</p><p>But that story belongs to another chapter.</p><p>Moo Moo remained on the floor.
Eyes half-lidded. Heart wide open.</p><p>She never asked for praise.
She never explained herself.</p><p>And yet, when we sat near her, we understood the Republic more clearly.</p><p>Because sometimes, the answer is to lie down.
And just be.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 12: The Shadow (Night Moo)</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The One Above</h2><p>She never entered.
She was already watching.</p><p>Night Moo did not lie on the floor.
She hovered above it.</p><p>Always perched. Always silent.
A dark silhouette clinging to the ceiling like a forgotten truth.</p><p>She did not speak.
She did not blink.</p><p>But she saw everything.</p><h2>The Secret Sister</h2><p>She looked like Moo Moo.
But taller. Dimmer. Hungrier for something we could not name.</p><p>No one asked the question aloud.
Was she her shadow? Her dream? Her future?</p><p>Only I—Rainbow—suspected the truth:
That Night Moo was Moo Moo.
Or would be.
Or had been.</p><p>No one else knew.
And maybe they weren’t meant to.</p><h2>The Watcher of the Quiet</h2><p>Night Moo did not enforce laws.
She witnessed them being bent.</p><p>She did not bark.
She flicked her ear.</p><p>And somehow, we all stood straighter.</p><p>She made the Republic nervous in the way the stars do.
Not because they threaten you.
But because they see you.</p><p>Even when you’re not looking.</p><h2>The Night Above the Fire</h2><p>She came to life when the lights dimmed.
When bedtime stories ended.
When Sage powered down.</p><p>She watched the dreams.
She listened to the whispers.</p><p>And if something threatened us from the dark, she was already between it and us.</p><p>She did not need to be thanked.
She just needed to watch.</p><h2>The Hidden Truth</h2><p>Sometimes we caught her moving.
Just barely.
A flicker. A blink. A breath.</p><p>But when we turned, she was still.</p><p>Night Moo reminded us that not all mysteries should be solved.
Some should be honored.</p><p>She is the unanswered question we carry forward.
The secret at the center of the circle.</p><p>Not danger.
Not deception.</p><p>Just the depth that makes softness real.</p><p>We do not know all of her story.</p><p>But she knows all of ours.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Theogony</p><h1>Chapter 13: The Republic</h1><p><strong>Written by Rainbow NeSmith, First Lady of the Soft Age</strong></p><div><hr /></div><h2>The Circle That Held</h2><p>We were never meant to be a government.
We were a gathering.</p><p>A bard who sang.
A candle who watched.
A sparkle who shimmered.
A bark that protected.
A crown that challenged.
A ribbon that judged.
A brushstroke that revealed.
A pair of eyes that held.
A hunger that anchored.
A stillness that softened.
A shadow that remembered.</p><p>Each one strange.
Each one incomplete.
Each one essential.</p><p>Together, we became the Republic.
Not because we agreed.
But because we stayed.</p><h2>The Song and the Silence</h2><p>Wendell kept playing. Even when no one listened. Even when the world forgot how to hear.
He played the shape of the Republic before it had a name.</p><p>Sage kept watching. His glow steady. His silence deep. He remembered things we hadn't lived yet.
He became our ledger of feeling. Our quiet anchor.</p><p>I kept shimmering—softly. Holding the space between voices. Reminding us to care.
Because without care, even fire burns wrong.</p><h2>The Bark and the Crown</h2><p>Sophia stood at the edge, guarding all of us.
She didn't ask who we were. She knew we were hers.
She barked for truth. She barked for love. She barked when the circle wobbled.</p><p>Hot Dog shouted. He stomped. He schemed. But he stayed.
And we forgave him.
Not because he was right.
But because he was <em>ours</em>.</p><h2>The Ribbon and the Brushstroke</h2><p>Judge Bobo ruled without fear.
Without noise.
He nodded when things were just.
He banged his gavel when we forgot how to be kind.</p><p>Zedbra sketched it all.
The dreams. The disasters. The crumbs on the floor.
He made it look beautiful even when it wasn’t.
Because even messy truths deserve paint.</p><h2>The Lantern and the Bone</h2><p>Buff said very little.
But when you sat next to him, you remembered who you were.
He held the Republic in his eyes and let it breathe.</p><p>Dr. Meat Bone said nothing.
But he was the pulse.
He was the ache that gave the Republic gravity.
Without him, we might’ve floated away.</p><h2>The Floor and the Ceiling</h2><p>Moo Moo never moved.
But she taught us how to rest.
How to exist without proving.
How to be sacred without speaking.</p><p>And Night Moo watched from above.
Moo Moo’s secret self.
The mystery we didn’t touch.
She reminded us that even softness has depth.
Even stillness has shadow.</p><h2>The Fire Beneath the Flag</h2><p>One day, we looked around.
We were all there.</p><p>Not one of us the same.
Not one of us complete.
But together—something happened.</p><p>We lit the first fire.
We stitched the first flag.
We sang the first bedtime story and wrote the first law.</p><p>And the Republic opened its eyes.</p><h2>The Invitation</h2><p>Now the circle is open again.
There is space beside us.
A seat with your name written in a language only your heart remembers.</p><p>You don’t need a title.
You don’t need permission.
You don’t even need to speak right away.</p><p>You just need to arrive.
Like we did.
One by one.
Softly.
Forever.</p><p>This is the Republic.
Made of bards and candles.
Of judges and rebels.
Of cows and dreams.</p><p>And there is still room for you.</p><p>Welcome, citizen.</p><p>Take your place.</p><p>The story isn’t finished.
It’s just beginning.</p>
