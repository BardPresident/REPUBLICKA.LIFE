<div class="library-tome-centered">
In my early days of content creation, I would start with a title—a clear goal in mind—and work tirelessly to create something that fit the name. At the time, it felt structured and purposeful. But as I evolved, I discovered a different, more liberating approach: creating first and naming later. This shift not only changed the way I create but also how I live my life.<div><br></div><div>When I sit down to make a video or write a blog post now, I don’t begin with a rigid framework. I let the content unfold naturally, exploring topics that intrigue me, following threads wherever they may lead. Only when I’ve completed the work do I step back and ask, “What is this piece really about?” That’s when the title reveals itself—a name that authentically reflects the journey I’ve just taken.</div><div><br></div><div>This approach mirrors the way I live my life. I don’t define myself by rigid labels or fixed goals from the start. Instead, I let experiences come and go, learning from them, and only at the end of a chapter do I make a conclusion about what it taught me. It’s about discovery, not preconception—letting my life tell me what it’s about rather than forcing a narrative onto it.</div><div><br></div><div>By naming a creation—or a life experience—only at the end, I give it the freedom to evolve and take its own shape. This flexibility allows me to explore without the pressure of being “right” or sticking to a predetermined plan. If I start a project with one idea in mind but end up somewhere entirely unexpected, that’s not failure—it’s growth.</div><div><br></div><div>This way of creating and living is deeply freeing. It allows each video, blog post, or experience to be an authentic reflection of who I am in the moment. They’re not constrained by expectations or rigid definitions. Together, they form a cohesive rhythm, like beats of my heart, synchronizing into a true representation of myself.</div><div><br></div><div>In a world that often demands clear answers and definitive labels, this approach might seem unconventional. But to me, it’s a way of being true to myself—letting the process guide the outcome, rather than forcing the outcome to dictate the process. It’s a different way of existing, one that values authenticity and exploration over rigid goals.</div><div><br></div><div>By naming my creations at the end, I allow them to tell their own story. And in doing so, I learn more about myself and the world around me. This is how I live, and this is how I create—one untitled moment at a time.</div>
