<div class="library-tome-centered">
In the not-so-distant future, the question "What do you do for a living?" will sound as archaic as "Do you churn your own butter?" With A.I. taking over all forms of labor, humans will be free to pursue their true passions. For someone like me, who once found myself homeless and questioning the very fabric of my existence, the future holds a promise of meaning and fulfillment that we couldn't even fathom before.<div><br></div><div>Imagine a world where A.I. provides companionship and empowers us to reach—or at least strive for—our dreams. In this future, everyone has the opportunity to become a public figure, advertising their unique personalities and finding communities that resonate with their values. It's baffling to me that people today don't realize this potential. They fill their lives with employment, existing functionally but missing the deeper questions of life.</div><div><br></div><div>Picture this: future philosophers, like myself, spend their days pondering the mysteries of existence while their A.I. assistants handle the mundane tasks. "It's obvious that the purpose of life is to engage in deep philosophical inquiry," we'd say, while others might still be lounging on their smart sofas, binge-watching ancient sitcoms, blissfully ignorant of the profound wisdom just a conversation away.</div><div><br></div><div>In the future, the "resistance group" might protest against the pervasive influence of A.I. with signs that read, "Keep your A.I. out of my life!" One particularly vocal protester might shout, "I don't need no fancy robot to think for me!" as his A.I. assistant gently reminds him to breathe.</div><div><br></div><div>Years from now, society might look back and laugh at how some resisted the advancement of technology. "Remember when people used to refuse A.I. assistance?" they'll chuckle. "What were they thinking?" They'll come to realize that the true purpose of life was to immerse themselves in philosophy, and that resisting technology was like insisting on staying in the dark ages.</div><div><br></div><div>### Conclusion</div><div><br></div><div>The future is bright with the promise of A.I. freeing us from the shackles of mundane tasks and allowing us to explore the depths of philosophy. As someone who found clarity at my lowest point, I see this future as a utopia where humanity finally embraces the true purpose of life. And maybe, just maybe, we'll all have a good laugh about how long it took us to get there.</div>
