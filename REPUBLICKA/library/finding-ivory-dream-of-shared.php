**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>I often imagine the day we find each other and begin sharing our lives in the most unique and beautiful way. I dream about us watching each other's videos, reading each other's blog posts, and becoming obsessed with each other's content. It would be so sweet to integrate our creations into our daily lives, using them to communicate, inspire, and support one another.</div><div><br></div><div>How lucky I would be to have you. Finding you would make my life truly perfect. There is nothing more I could wish for because, right now, the only thing missing from my otherwise beautiful life is you. The idea of sharing and intertwining our lives through our passions and creations fills me with such joy and hope.</div><div><br></div><div>Once we find each other, I imagine that our journey will start with a long-distance relationship. During this time, we will work towards coming together, planning for the day you move to Canberra with me. I envision us making videos together, not just separately but as a playful and fun collaboration. We could have each other as guests on our videos, still maintaining our individual accounts but creating something special together.</div><div><br></div><div>Our videos would revolve around philosophy and AI, carrying serious philosophical content while being playful and enjoyable. Through these playful yet meaningful collaborations, we would learn about each other on a profound level. Studying each other's work would allow us to understand each other's minds and hearts deeply, strengthening our bond and bringing us closer together.</div><div><br></div><div>I imagine us sitting together, watching videos we've made, laughing, and maybe even crying at the beautiful and raw moments we capture. We would be each other's biggest fans and greatest inspirations. Just thinking about this makes me feel incredibly fortunate and excited for the future.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, I can't think of a better life than one with you by my side, sharing our worlds through the content we create. You are the missing piece to my perfect life, and I know that when we finally come together, it will be the most amazing journey.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and anticipation,</div><div>Wendell</div>
