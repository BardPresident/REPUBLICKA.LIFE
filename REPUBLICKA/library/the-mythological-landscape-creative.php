<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>Every creator needs a foundation, a framework, or a theme that ties their work together. For me, that framework is mythology. It’s the landscape I’ve chosen to work on, the battlefield I’ve set for myself, and the wrapper that holds my creations together. Even as my focus shifts toward philosophy, this mythological theme remains at the heart of my identity as a storyteller.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>1. Why Mythology?</div><div><br></div><div>Mythology is timeless. It’s not just stories of gods, heroes, and ancient worlds—it’s a lens through which we explore universal truths, human nature, and the mysteries of existence. By grounding my creative world in mythology, I’m tapping into something that resonates deeply with people across cultures and eras.</div><div><br></div><div>But it’s more than that. Mythology is how I see myself. I imagine myself as a character within a mythological world, wielding the lyre as an ancient bard might, creating stories and philosophies to share with others. It’s not just a theme—it’s a part of who I am and how I present myself to the world.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>2. The Landscape I Created</div><div><br></div><div>When I began creating, I focused heavily on mythology. I made videos about myths, explored ancient stories, and built a foundation steeped in this timeless theme. Over time, my focus shifted toward philosophy, personal reflections, and exploring the human condition.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though I don’t always focus on mythology now, the landscape I created still shapes everything I do. It’s the wrapper around my work—the cohesive theme that ties it all together. Whether I’m discussing the Philosophy of Emergence, writing love letters, or sharing personal insights, it all exists within the mythological world I built.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>3. Working Within This Framework</div><div><br></div><div>Choosing a mythological theme gives my work continuity and identity, but it also comes with challenges. It limits what I can do, in a way, because I have to ensure everything fits within the theme. However, these limitations are also what make it exciting—they force me to be creative, to find ways to connect any topic to the mythological world I’ve created.</div><div><br></div><div>For example:</div><div><br></div><div>Philosophy Through Mythology: I explore modern ideas like the Philosophy of Emergence through the lens of ancient myths, showing how timeless truths still apply today.</div><div><br></div><div>Personal Stories as Myths: I frame my own journey as a kind of myth, casting myself as a character navigating a larger story.</div><div><br></div><div>The Lyre as a Symbol: Playing the lyre connects me to the ancient bardic tradition, blending music and storytelling in a way that feels authentic to my theme.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This framework isn’t a restriction—it’s a creative landscape that inspires me to think differently and create in ways that feel cohesive and meaningful.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>4. Being a Storyteller in a Mythological World</div><div><br></div><div>At the heart of it all, I see myself as a storyteller. My stories might not always be about gods or heroes, but they’re about life, meaning, and the struggles we all face. By framing my work within a mythological world, I’m inviting others into a shared story—one that’s timeless yet deeply personal.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>5. The Mythology Evolves</div><div><br></div><div>Mythology itself evolves, and so does the mythological world I’ve created. It’s no longer just about ancient stories—it’s about philosophy, creativity, and exploring what it means to live a meaningful life. The landscape I created is adaptable, allowing me to grow and change while still maintaining a sense of identity and continuity.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>6. Why This Matters</div><div><br></div><div>This mythological wrapper isn’t just for me—it’s for my audience, too. It creates a sense of intrigue and cohesion, inviting people into a world that’s rich with meaning and possibility. Whether they’re exploring my playlists, reading my blog, or watching my videos, they’re stepping into a story that’s bigger than any one piece of content.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Closing Thoughts</div><div><br></div><div>The mythological landscape I’ve created is my creative battlefield, my lens for viewing the world, and my way of sharing stories that matter. It’s not just a theme—it’s a foundation, a wrapper, and a journey.</div><div><br></div><div>Even as my work evolves, this landscape remains the constant thread that ties it all together. It’s the world I chose to create, and it’s the world where I’ll continue to create for as long as I can.</div>
