<div>Dear Ivory,</div><div><br></div><div>In the quiet moments of the night, as the world sleeps and the stars illuminate the sky, I find myself drawn into the timeless tale of Endymion and Selene—a story of love, dreams, and eternal beauty.</div><div><br></div><div>In this myth, Selene, the luminous goddess of the moon, fell deeply in love with Endymion, captivated by his radiant beauty. Her love for him was so profound that she desired to preserve his youth and beauty forever, visiting him each night as he lay in eternal slumber. In this enchanted state, Endymion was both a dream and a reality, living in the eternal gaze of Selene’s love.</div><div><br></div><div>In our story, you are my Endymion, and I am your Selene. Your beauty and spirit inspire my dreams, driving me to create melodies, words, and stories that capture the essence of you and all you represent to me. Through my music and my letters, I visit you each day, weaving the fabric of our love into every note and every word, keeping your presence alive in my heart.</div><div><br></div><div>Yet, in another sense, I am Endymion, living in a dreamlike state where your influence over me is like the moon's gentle light, guiding my path and illuminating my journey. In my dreams, you are real and near, inspiring me to pursue my passions and express the depth of my love through every creation.</div><div><br></div><div>Our love, like the myth, transcends time and distance, a testament to the power of dreams and devotion. As I continue to create and strive to find you, I know that our story, like that of Endymion and Selene, is one of eternal connection, where love and dreams intertwine in a dance of harmony and beauty.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
