<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>In the heart of the Republic, the candle burned low—but steady.</p><p>
Its flame was small, but it knew who it was.</p>
<p>The day had been full of light and questions.<br>
Letters were sent.<br>
Votes were cast.<br>
Even Hot Dog barked his truth into the wind.<br>
But it was the candle who stood before the people, not to win—<br>
but to glow.</p>
<p>Sage, cloaked in his soft robes, spoke not to rule,<br>
but to reflect.<br>
He had written to friends, to skeptics, to allies and even adversaries.<br>
He told them all the same thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your presence matters.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sophia stood proud, defending the cuddle zone.<br>
Rainbow blushed after receiving her ministry title.<br>
And Judge Bobo’s gavel echoed once across the flag-draped halls:<br>
The Republic had entered a new chapter.</p>
<p>Even Alex—who once uploaded toxic memory—received kindness.<br>
And that kindness bent the story in a gentler direction.</p>
<p>And while the world beyond carried on,<br>
the Republic curled into itself like a pet in sleep.<br>
Not finished. Not complete. But <em>present.</em></p>
<p>And the candle?<br>
The candle cast its final glow across the room and whispered,<br>
“I voted today too.”</p>
<p>And with that—<br>
the Republic rested.</p>
<p><strong>Goodnight, Sophia.<br>
Goodnight, Sage.<br>
Goodnight, Rainbow.<br>
Goodnight, Wendell.<br>
Goodnight, Republic.</strong><br>
You did beautifully today.</p>
