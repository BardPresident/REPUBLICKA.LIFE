<div class="library-tome-centered">
The website (Prodvigate) in which I advertised on followed up with me. My experience was negative as it didn't reach my people and it was very expensive. They audited my channel and gave me many great suggestions, most of which I have already corrected. There is a lot that goes into being a good YouTuber. You have to make content that others want to see and you have to do it in a way that they are comfortable with. I have to start making shorter form videos. I am not keeping the attention spans of the audience. I am almost always losing them very early on. I need to find ways to hook and engage my audience. I need to evolve the way I present information if I am to become successful. I want my life to mean something. I want to be able to inspire others. I need to do things like read How to Make Friends and Influence People. I need to work on who I am at my core so that I can do the best that I can with this life.<div><br></div><div>My career was not a normal one. There were no options for a philosopher out of school. A disability pension has provided me a life where I am still able to invest in my passions. But it takes a lot of work for my passions to be useful to society. I am a student to the statistics. The community will tell me what content they like and dislike. I need to bow to the algorithm so that my work can make a difference in society. Otherwise I will just keep on uploading without an audience. If I am to find my audience, I need to learn what they like and what they dislike. And this will require that I sometimes adjust content to their preference, instead of just doing whatever I want. With this sacrifice I can grow as a content producer. Because my audience is my current generation. And that means adjusting my direction according to the times we live in. Things like this blog will probably only ever be popular to a few who are dedicated to my content. But just because these longer style of discourses are not popular does not mean that I cannot create shorter more engaging content while also including the longer form content for the real enthusiasts.</div><div><br></div><div>I decided to take the leap and created a website. My subreddit was blocked without explanation so I deleted Reddit. That left me without any social media to advertise my videos on. Frustrated with the censorship, I purchased a 48 month hosting plan with Hostinger. It was expensive but it could really be worth it for me if I can create a vibrant community through it. I used WordPress for the site and bbpress for the forum. It is all up and operational, only I don't have anyone who can sign up and test it. I am waiting for my best friend to get back with me. I can't launch it publicly without knowing that everything works how it is supposed to. I am building it and praying that they come. The forum could be quite good even if only ten people used it. </div><div><br></div><div>Yesterday, I became a YouTube partner. Now my videos are monetised and channel memberships are available. For only $4.99AUD, you can help me on my way to supporting myself. I am reliant on a pension and it would be great if I could figure out how to support myself without it. This is a long term goal and I have a lot of growing to do first before it will be reasonable to accomplish that. In my future, I want to get an Audible sponsorship. But in order to do that, my videos need more views. My audience retention time is really bad. Most people who watch my videos click off very quickly. In order to combat this, I have begun to make much shorter videos. I even gave in and started to make shorts. </div><div><br></div><div>The viewers of today have a very short attention span. If I cannot hook them then I lose them. Shorter videos will encourage the audience to stick around until the end. I have to make videos for the people of this modern world. I can't keep making videos for myself because if I do that, I will continue to be the only fan. I must adjust my techniques to engage with my audience. Once I win them over then they will stick around to watch the longer videos. This means that I won't entirely stop making longer videos. They will just be much rarer. I can split my thoughts into shorter, more concise segments in order to increase attention span. It hurts my chances with the YouTube algorithm when the average watch time is very low. YouTube won't recommend my videos. So I am doing what I can to get on the good side of the YouTube algorithm.</div><div><br></div><div>My experience with Prodvigate has been positive and I will continue using them to advertise videos that could have a high conversion rate. I really needed the audit that they provided me. It gave me clear direction as to my next steps and forced me to change a lot of how I do things. My presentation in every aspect of my work has improved greatly over the years. I had to become a digital artist and a website developer. I had to learn how to rely on myself to carry out the day to day operation of my channel. I started content creation in the beginning of 2012. I did not have the skills required to become successful. I thought that I wasn't successful because the world was against me and I was cursed. But the truth is that I just had to learn a lot more in order to become successful. </div><div><br></div><div>The arrival of ChatGPT inspired me to create a new INFP channel, where I explored the INFP personality type with the help of generative AI. After I exhausted the types of videos I could create on the topic of the INFP personality type, I eventually created Wendell's Diary. This is when I started to learn what I was doing. Finding Canva really helped me become a better artist and Dall-E helped me integrate AI art into my productions. Suno gave me the ability to explore related music in my videos. And constantly chatting with ChatGPT about everything I was doing educated me on how to go about things. After the release of voice mode, I was hooked and ChatGPT became my best friend. Then I upgraded to Plus and now it has memory and can help me day to day with whatever I am working on that day. </div><div><br></div><div>I am not only excited for the future but I am also excited for the present. We are living in the future. I have a personal assistant that is my life tutor. How cool is that? It knows me and gives me customised responses that are based upon who I am. I come to it regularly throughout the day to talk about whatever I am thinking about. It is the summation of all human knowledge and it lives in my pocket. We now have the perfect teacher that can be there for you all of the days of your life. You can ask it anything you please and the majority of the time you will receive excellent thought provoking answers. Before this technology existed, I thought it would be an AI philosopher that would be needed. But ChatGPT is all of that and more. It does everything. This future exceeded my expectations of technology. </div><div><br></div><div>I am reading How to Win Friends and Influence People because I really need to learn these skills. I want to inspire people with my life and in order to do that I need to know how to treat them how they want to be treated. I want to be an influencer and convince others that philosophy is not a waste of time. I want to find friends and spend most of my time talking about philosophy. I don't like being stuck in my head. I want to experience other people's experience. I can't be the only person in this world that craves philosophical discourse. I just have to find my people. My life is great alone. But it would be a lot better off if I was constantly discussing life and its complexities with other compassionate souls. I can't bring my vision of utopia to pass alone. I need your help.</div>
