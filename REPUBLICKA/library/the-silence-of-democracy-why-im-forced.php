<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>In a true democracy, leaders, businesses, and institutions should be open to dialogue with the public. Yet, as I navigate my political campaign with the Emergence Party, I am met with silence—from companies, from social platforms, and even from the people who stand to benefit most from the issues I raise.</div><div><br></div><div>This has left me with only one option: writing open letters, pleading for engagement because direct communication isn’t possible. But the fact that I have to do this is deeply sad—it speaks to a broken system where leaders and institutions ignore voices that don’t already have power or influence.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Why Do I Have to Write Open Letters?</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t want to write letters into the void, hoping that someone important might eventually acknowledge them. I want real conversations, real engagement, and a chance to actually communicate with the people who hold power over these issues.</div><div><br></div><div>But here’s what keeps happening:</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 Social media companies won’t respond. Instead of engaging with concerns about political visibility, they use automated systems that leave candidates like me unheard.</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 Mainstream media won’t cover new political movements. Unless you’re part of an established party or have corporate backing, your voice is ignored.</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 The public doesn’t see independent candidates. The systems in place prevent people from discovering new perspectives, making it difficult to build engagement even when the issues I discuss affect every single Australian.</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 Corporations refuse to acknowledge criticism. Companies that control the digital public square shut out discussions that challenge their influence, creating a controlled environment where only certain voices are heard.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Tragedy of a One-Way Conversation</div><div><br></div><div>What’s most frustrating is that these aren’t small personal grievances—these are pressing public issues.</div><div><br></div><div>📢 Voting laws affect every Australian.</div><div>📢 Social media censorship shapes public discourse.</div><div>📢 Independent candidates deserve a fair chance to be heard.</div><div><br></div><div>Yet, when I try to engage in conversation about these topics, I’m left talking to myself. Writing open letters is not true engagement—it’s a desperate attempt to be heard when all other avenues are blocked.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>What Needs to Change?</div><div><br></div><div>If we truly care about democracy, free speech, and open discussion, we need to:</div><div><br></div><div>🔹 Hold companies accountable for their role in shaping political engagement.</div><div>🔹 Encourage independent voices to be heard—not just corporate-backed candidates.</div><div>🔹 Create more direct channels for public discussion, where real conversations can happen.</div><div>🔹 Challenge the systems that prevent meaningful engagement from taking place.</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party is about creating a political environment where people are actually heard—not just by screaming into the void of social media algorithms but by directly engaging with those in power.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Call for Engagement</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t want to write another open letter. I want to talk to people, hear their concerns, and have meaningful discussions that actually lead to change.</div><div><br></div><div>But until the system allows independent voices to be part of the conversation, I’ll keep writing.</div><div><br></div><div>Because silence is not an option—even when no one wants to listen.</div><div><br></div><div>🔗 Join the conversation at wendellsdiary.com</div>
