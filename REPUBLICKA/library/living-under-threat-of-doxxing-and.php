<div class="library-tome-centered">
In the digital age, the fear of doxxing and harassment is an unfortunate reality for many, including myself. I want to share my experience with this issue and how it has shaped my life and online presence.<div><br></div><div>#### How It Began</div><div><br></div><div>My YouTube channel gained traction, and that’s when the harassment started. I stumbled upon a website where people were sharing information about me, calling me derogatory names, and discussing ways to expose my personal details. It was a shocking and disturbing experience, and they haven’t left me alone since.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Impact on Daily Life</div><div><br></div><div>This harassment has severely limited the services I can use. Many platforms have vulnerabilities that make it risky for me to participate, restricting my ability to engage freely online and impacting my daily activities.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Measures to Protect Myself</div><div><br></div><div>To protect my personal information, I’ve deleted content that revealed too much and reported the issue to the police. Unfortunately, their ability to help is limited, especially when the threats come from international sources. It’s been a frustrating and limited form of support.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Coping with Emotional Impact</div><div><br></div><div>I try to maintain a belief in the goodness of people, but it’s challenging when so much of my audience consists of stalkers or haters. The lack of genuine support makes it difficult to stay positive, but I strive to focus on the constructive aspects of my work.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Lack of Support</div><div><br></div><div>I haven’t received support from communities or individuals, which has made coping even harder. There’s a general notion that being a public figure comes with the inevitability of stalkers, which I find deeply unfair. No one should have to endure harassment just for being in the public eye.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Keeping Content Positive</div><div><br></div><div>To ensure my interactions remain positive, I’ve limited my contact methods to YouTube and Blogger comments. It’s a compromise that helps protect me while still allowing some level of engagement with my audience.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Advice for Others</div><div><br></div><div>My advice to others facing similar threats is simple: don’t let it stop you from creating. Contributing to humanity and pursuing your passions are more important than the trials you face. Keep going, despite the challenges.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Balancing Protection and Engagement</div><div><br></div><div>The need to protect myself means I can’t have direct contact with my audience beyond comments. It’s not ideal, but it’s the safest way I’ve found to maintain an online presence without exposing myself to further risk.</div><div><br></div><div>**Call to Action:** If you’ve experienced similar issues or have insights to share, connect with me through comments on my blog at [wendellsdiary.com](https://wendellsdiary.com). Also, check out my YouTube channel for more content and join the discussion there. Your support and engagement mean a lot to me.</div>
