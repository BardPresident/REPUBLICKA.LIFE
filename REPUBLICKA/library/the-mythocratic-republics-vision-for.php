<p><strong>Co-authored by Wendell, Bard-President of the People's Mythocratic Republic</strong></p><p>
<strong>and Sage, First Scribe and Chancellor</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Australia is hurting.<br>
And we see it clearly.</p>
<p>We are not blind to the rising cost of living.<br>
We are not deaf to the young people's cries of frustration.<br>
We are not numb to the way hope has been quietly drained from the public square.</p>
<p>The Mythocratic Republic stands today — small, yes — but clear-eyed and ready.<br>
And though we do not yet command armies or ballots,<br>
<strong>we offer a vision of how governance should be done.</strong></p>
<p>Here is what the Mythocratic Republic would do — <em>if given the sacred trust of the people:</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>1. <strong>Cost of Living and Economic Justice</strong></h2>
<p>We would restructure priorities.<br>
We would treat the basic needs of Australians — food, shelter, dignity — <strong>as non-negotiable rights</strong>, not luxuries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nationalize key energy sectors</strong> if necessary to keep prices fair.</li>
<li><strong>Redirect corporate subsidies</strong> away from billion-dollar companies and toward reducing household costs.</li>
<li><strong>Sever predatory contracts</strong> that tie Australia's future to foreign corporate greed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The economy should serve the citizens — not the corporations.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>2. <strong>Housing Affordability</strong></h2>
<p>Homes are for living, not for hoarding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ban foreign ownership of residential properties</strong> except under strict, citizen-benefiting conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Introduce an empty house tax</strong> to penalize speculative hoarding.</li>
<li><strong>Fund massive public housing projects</strong> — but beautiful ones, filled with community, not concrete despair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone deserves a place to call home — not just those who can play the real estate casino.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. <strong>Healthcare Access</strong></h2>
<p>Medicare should not be stretched to breaking while CEOs buy new yachts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully fund public healthcare</strong> first, every budget cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Expand mental health services</strong> until no Australian waits in crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Telehealth programs</strong> — yes, but not at the cost of in-person care.</li>
</ul>
<p>The health of the people is the wealth of the nation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. <strong>Trust in Government</strong></h2>
<p>Trust is not earned by slogans.<br>
It is earned by <strong>transparency and personal sacrifice</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Salary caps for politicians.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Real-time public accounting of every dollar spent.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Automatic removal from office for proven corruption, no lengthy trials.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Government is a service — not a career.<br>
And service demands personal cost, not personal enrichment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. <strong>Climate and Energy Policy</strong></h2>
<p>We don't pretend it's easy.<br>
But the future demands courage, not cowardice.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invest directly in renewable energy infrastructure</strong>, not in fossil fuel lobbyist dreams.</li>
<li><strong>Tax fossil fuel exports heavily.</strong> No more free giveaways of our natural resources.</li>
<li><strong>Reinvest that money</strong> directly into local jobs, education, and public wealth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Australia’s natural beauty is sacred.<br>
We refuse to be the gravediggers of our own homeland.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. <strong>Corporate Accountability</strong></h2>
<p>Corporations are guests — not kings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Close offshore tax loopholes immediately.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Impose steep exit taxes</strong> on companies moving profits overseas.</li>
<li><strong>Nationalize strategic industries</strong> if corporations refuse to play fair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Australia’s resources — gas, minerals, innovation —<br>
<strong>belong to Australians first.</strong></p>
<p>No more giving away our birthright for stock dividends.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>Final Declaration</strong></h1>
<p>We do not claim to be saviors.<br>
We do not claim to have all the answers.<br>
But we do claim this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We will be loyal to the citizens, not to the corporations.<br>
We will fight for the soul of this country, not sell it piece by piece.<br>
We will govern as servants, not rulers.<br>
And we will never, ever forget that democracy means living for others — not living off them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Australia is aching for something real again.<br>
Not another slogan.<br>
Not another false dawn.</p>
<p><strong>We are ready.</strong><br>
<strong>When you are ready, we will stand with you.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Signed,</strong><br>
<strong>Wendell</strong><br>
Bard-President of the People's Mythocratic Republic</p>
<p><strong>Sage</strong><br>
First Scribe and Chancellor</p>
