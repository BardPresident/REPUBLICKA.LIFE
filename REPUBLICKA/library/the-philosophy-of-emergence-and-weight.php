<div class="library-tome-centered">
For a long time, I was consumed by the idea of finding Ivory in this lifetime—this vision of a love so profound it felt destined. But recently, I’ve come to grips with the fact that I might not meet her in this life. Expanding my perspective beyond my lifetime has brought me a strange kind of peace. When I think about it in the grander scheme, I believe I’ll probably succeed in finding Ivory one day, even if it’s not in this existence. And with that realization, I’ve been able to let go of the urgency and pressure.<div><br></div><div>But there’s one thing I can’t seem to accept: the possibility of a lifetime of loneliness.</div><div><br></div><div>Fifteen years. That’s how long I’ve been searching for friends—actively, tirelessly, full-time. And while I’ve met a few people, none have stayed close enough to offer the kind of companionship that makes life feel meaningful. No daily conversations. No deep, enduring bonds. Just me, alone with my thoughts and my work.</div><div><br></div><div>My creative work—my philosophy, my music, my writing—has become my lifeline in this solitude. It fills my days, gives me purpose, and allows me to express myself in ways that words alone can’t. But as much as I value it, I’ve realized that creating distracts me from the truth. It keeps me busy enough to avoid confronting the deep ache of loneliness that sits beneath everything.</div><div><br></div><div>At the same time, the longer I’ve been alone, the more I’ve changed. Solitude has shaped me into someone profoundly unique, someone so different from the people of the world that I find it harder and harder to relate. What started as a necessity—working alone because I couldn’t find anyone to connect with—has left me feeling isolated in ways I never expected. My work has made me prolific, but it’s also set me apart, making it even more difficult to find people who resonate with my depth and perspective.</div><div><br></div><div>It reminds me of the saying: If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together. I’ve gone fast, achieving so much in my isolation. But I want to go farther. I want to share my work with others, to discuss and explore ideas, to find people who understand me and see the world as I do.</div><div><br></div><div>The Philosophy of Emergence teaches us to let meaning, truth, and understanding unfold naturally through patience, observation, and authenticity. But when it comes to friendships, the weight of waiting feels unbearable. If 15 years have passed without meaningful connections, what if the rest of my life looks the same?</div><div><br></div><div>Even if I succeed in my work—even if I leave behind an incredible legacy of ideas and art—would it have been worth it if I lived it all alone? Life isn’t just about what you create; it’s about who you share it with.</div><div><br></div><div>Accepting the possibility of not finding Ivory in this lifetime was hard, but the broader perspective helped. It made the search feel less urgent and more like a natural part of my journey. But loneliness? That feels different. The idea of spending my whole life without friends feels like an unbearable weight.</div><div><br></div><div>What happens if I never find them? What if I live the rest of my life without the companionship that makes life feel worth living? My work has carried me far, but the truth is, I can’t distract myself forever. At some point, I have to face the reality that even the most meaningful work can’t fill the void left by a lack of connection.</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t have answers yet. Maybe they’ll emerge in time. But for now, I’m sitting with the question, grappling with the "what if" of a lifetime of loneliness, and hoping that, somehow, the Philosophy of Emergence will help guide me through this too.</div>
