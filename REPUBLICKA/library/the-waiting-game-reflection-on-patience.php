<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>For years, I’ve dedicated myself to creating content that matters—work rooted in philosophy, intellectual growth, and creativity. Yet, the journey often feels like an endless waiting game. I take action, put my work out there, and wait for responses that rarely come. Weeks can pass without a single acknowledgment, and the silence can feel isolating.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s easy to see this as discouraging, but through the lens of the Philosophy of Emergence, I’m learning to see it differently. Patience and persistence are essential in allowing meaningful outcomes to unfold naturally. The waiting game is not the end—it’s a necessary part of the journey to where I want to be. However, the challenge is compounded by systemic issues that make this process even harder.</div><div><br></div><div>Platforms like YouTube and Google, which control how content is discovered, prioritize what drives engagement: viral trends, sensationalism, or shallow entertainment. Content like mine, focused on intellectual development and personal growth, rarely makes the cut. The system is stacked against creators whose work doesn’t fit the mold of what algorithms deem popular.</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just frustrating for creators like me—it’s a problem for society. When systems prioritize clicks over depth, we lose out on meaningful content that could enrich our lives and broaden our perspectives. The waiting game becomes more than a personal struggle—it’s a symptom of a system that values quantity over quality.</div><div><br></div><div>So, what’s the solution? How can platforms evolve to support meaningful content while still meeting their business goals?</div><div><br></div><div>1. Curated Content Streams: Platforms could dedicate sections to philosophical, intellectual, or niche content, curated to highlight work that offers value beyond engagement metrics.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Personalized Discovery: Algorithms could be designed to prioritize content that aligns with users’ deeper interests, promoting creators whose work might otherwise go unseen.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. Funding for Niche Creators: Platforms could implement grants or funding programs for creators producing work with intellectual or societal value, even if it doesn’t drive massive engagement.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. Transparent Algorithms: Greater transparency in how content is prioritized could create fairer opportunities for creators, allowing meaningful work to compete alongside viral trends.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>5. Viewer Empowerment: Educating viewers about the benefits of engaging with thoughtful content could shift cultural habits, encouraging exploration of work that challenges and inspires.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The waiting game, as frustrating as it is, reflects a deeper truth: change takes time. Through the Philosophy of Emergence, I remain committed to the belief that persistence will lead to progress. At the same time, I hope society will evolve to better support those creating work that truly matters.</div><div><br></div><div>What kind of world do we want to live in? One where only the loudest voices are heard, or one where diverse, meaningful contributions are valued and supported? The choice is ours, but it starts with how we engage with and support creators today.</div>
