<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>For the past thirteen years, I’ve dedicated my life to being a full-time content creator. I’ve poured my time, energy, and finances into work that I believe contributes meaningfully to humanity’s progress. Yet, despite this commitment, I can’t support myself through my passion. I live on a government pension, funded by taxpayers, and I don’t see a future where I can afford basic milestones like owning a house or a car.</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just about me—it’s about fairness and the kind of society we want to live in. Is it fair that someone who dedicates their life to creating, thinking, and contributing to humanity has no viable path to self-sufficiency? Is it right that people following unconventional but meaningful pursuits must rely on limited external support just to survive?</div><div><br></div><div>This situation highlights a deeper flaw in how society functions. We often talk about valuing creativity, innovation, and progress, but those who dedicate themselves to these pursuits rarely see that value reflected in financial or societal support. Instead, the system prioritizes profit-driven work over contributions that, while harder to quantify, deeply enrich our world.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s not just about financial strain—it’s also about loneliness. Creating meaningful work while feeling invisible or unsupported can be an isolating experience. And yet, I keep going, because I believe in what I’m doing. But the question remains: should it be this hard?</div><div><br></div><div>What do you think? Is it fair that creators and thinkers like me must rely on pensions and scrape by, even when their work is focused on advancing humanity? Is this the society we want to live in—one where contributions outside the mainstream aren’t valued enough to sustain a living?</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just my story. It’s a reflection of a system that often fails to support those working to enrich it. If we want a world where creativity and innovation thrive, shouldn’t we also ensure that those who dedicate their lives to such work have the means to support themselves?</div><div><br></div><div>I invite you to reflect on this with me. What kind of world do we want to build, and how do we ensure it’s fair to everyone contributing to it in meaningful ways?</div>
