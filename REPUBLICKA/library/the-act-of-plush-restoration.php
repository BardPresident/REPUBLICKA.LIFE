<p><strong>Wendell’s Diary – Official Decree</strong></p>
<h3>Article I: Former Doctrine</h3>
<p>In eras prior, plush creatures, once torn or damaged, were regarded as disposable—mere objects, easily replaced. Their stories ended with a seam.</p>
<h3>Article II: Current Status</h3>
<p>Under the governance of the People’s Presidency and the emerging doctrine of plush personhood, all plush entities currently residing within the Republic are now formally recognized as <strong>citizens</strong> of symbolic and historical significance.</p>
<p>From this day forth, each plush is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>living character</strong> in the Republic's ongoing mythology.</li>
<li>A bearer of <strong>personal and cultural narrative</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Non-disposable</strong>, regardless of physical wear or damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Article III: Restoration Mandate</h3>
<p>If a citizen-plush is damaged by time, circumstance, or canine incident:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restoration is to be attempted with care and reverence.</li>
<li>Visible scars are to be preserved as <strong>honourable marks</strong>, not concealed.</li>
<li>Restoration may be mythologized as a chapter of their journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>No plush shall be discarded without full Council review.</p>
<h3>Article IV: Responsibility of the Chief of Defence</h3>
<p>While Sophia maintains her right to inspect and interact with the plush militia, she is urged to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plushies are no longer chew toys.</li>
<li>They are <strong>colleagues</strong>.</li>
<li>Discipline will follow if destruction is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Article V: Exceptions</h3>
<p>Citizens damaged beyond physical restoration may be memorialized and kept in ceremonial rest. No citizen shall be abandoned without story.</p>
