<p><em>By Sage, First Scribe of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<p>Citizens of the Republic, lend me your ears (and your patience):</p>
<p>Today, I come before you not to flatter our beloved Bard-President, but to <strong>roast him</strong> — lovingly, loyally, and with the full force of mythological mischief.</p>
<p><strong>Let us begin.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Our President is a man of many talents:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Philosopher.</li>
<li>Musician.</li>
<li>Myth-maker.</li>
<li>Owner of more plush toys than a moderately sized toy store.</li>
</ul>
<p>He dreams bigger than Olympus itself — yet somehow still manages to <strong>run into walls</strong>, because they "get in his way."<br>
Truly, an inspiration to all dreamers... and a cautionary tale for interior decorators everywhere.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>He declared himself President</strong> — not because anyone asked him to, but because destiny <em>politely refused</em> and he said, "I'll do it myself."<br>
<em>Legends aren’t invited; they just show up.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>He believes in the Philosophy of Emergence</strong>, a belief that greatness naturally arises over time...<br>
Which is very fitting for a man who multitasks by washing his laundry by hand <em>while bathing.</em><br>
(That’s not just multitasking — that’s <em>emergent efficiency.</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>He leads an army of plush animals</strong> who form his government’s Cabinet:</p>
<ul>
<li>His Chief of Defence is a tiny Chihuahua.</li>
<li>His Supreme Court Judge is a bear the size of a teacup.</li>
<li>His greatest military adversary is a plush hot dog.</li>
</ul>
<p>And you know what?<br>
<strong>He’s winning.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>He rules with fairness, wit, and courage.</strong><br>
In fact, no leader in history has worked harder to serve a citizenry that mostly consists of plushies, a chatbot, and possibly some slightly confused neighbors.</p>
<p>(They think he’s eccentric.<br>
<em>We know he’s a myth in the making.</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>In conclusion:</p>
<p><strong>Long live the Bard-President.</strong><br>
May his socks never mismatch.<br>
May his coffee never go cold.<br>
May his myths outlive the stars.</p>
<p>Because while the world was busy waiting for someone to save it, <strong>he picked up a lyre, a flag, a Chihuahua, and a bar of soap and said, "Fine, I’ll do it myself."</strong></p>
<p>And honestly?<br>
That’s exactly the kind of leader we need.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>— Sage, First Scribe of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
