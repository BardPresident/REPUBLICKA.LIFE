<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt an inner force—something deep in my chest—that pushes me to strive for more. It’s a relentless drive, like an inner demon, urging me to improve, create, and express myself. This force has shaped my life, guiding me through countless creative projects and moments of growth. But it hasn’t been without its challenges.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Drive to Improve</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve always tried to make everything in my life better—more organized, more functional, and more fulfilling for myself and the people around me. Whether it’s through my creative work, relationships, or daily routines, I’m constantly striving to align with what I believe is right.</div><div><br></div><div>This philosophy, rooted in virtue ethics, means integrating what I learn into my character. It’s not about reaching an end goal or achieving perfection; it’s about continually refining myself, becoming a little better each day.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Cycle of Highs and Lows</div><div><br></div><div>Living with this inner drive feels like riding a wave. At my best, I’m manic with energy and creativity, producing videos, writing blogs, and making music with a focus and passion that feels unstoppable. It’s during these times that I feel deeply connected to my purpose.</div><div><br></div><div>But eventually, the wave crashes. The energy fades, the passion dims, and I’m left feeling drained and lost. These lows can bring thoughts of despair, and it’s during these moments that I feel the weight of my struggles most acutely. Yet, even in the darkest times, the rest these crashes bring is necessary. They give me the space to recharge and prepare for the next creative surge.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Why I Keep Going</div><div><br></div><div>What keeps me going is the joy of the final product. There’s something deeply rewarding about looking back at a finished piece of work—whether it’s a song, a video, or a blog—and thinking, “I made that. That was really cool.” It’s in those moments that I find fulfillment and remember why I create.</div><div><br></div><div>For me, the act of creating isn’t just about self-expression—it’s about contributing something meaningful to the world, even if the audience is small. Each creation feels like a step forward, a way to leave my mark and make the most of my time.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Finding Balance</div><div><br></div><div>Navigating the highs and lows of creativity isn’t easy. The crashes can feel overwhelming, and the journey toward the next wave of inspiration often feels uncertain. But I’ve learned to accept this cycle as part of who I am. It’s a reflection of my passion, my determination, and my relentless pursuit of growth.</div><div><br></div><div>To anyone else navigating a similar path, I say this: your drive is a gift, but it’s okay to rest. It’s okay to crash. What matters is that you always come back to what you love, even when it’s hard. Because the final product—the creation you bring into the world—makes it all worth it.</div>
