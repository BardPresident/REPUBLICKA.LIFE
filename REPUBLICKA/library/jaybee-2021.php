<h1 style="text-align: left;"><b>Jaybee</b></h1><p>December 5, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Like a lily among thistles is my darling among young women.</p><p><br /></p><p>Song of Songs 2:2</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Ivory Virgin</p><p>November 18, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>There exists a social issue that goes bump in the night. Righteousness is passed off as evil as our world is destroyed as a result of the taboo of the topic. For females are only marriageable material when they reach eighteen. Before that, they have no romantic or sexual urges. They cannot be trusted to make sound decisions because they are too young. There exists no consent for them because their brains are too immature to make a decision such as marriage. For marriage now days is reserved for those in their thirties. For life is about banging as many chicks as possible until you decide to settle down. The potential for an eager mind to be led in marriage is off limits to these juveniles. They must find people their own ages or go without a romantic partner.</p><p><br /></p><p>This book is intended to say my peace on child marriages. After all that I have been through, it is very unlikely that I will find the type of person described in this book. This book will be hidden because I have no way to advertise my work anymore. As a result, I will speak much more freely than I usually do. This book is meant to go into history for prosperity's sake. It is not meant to benefit me in any way. There is no audience in mind while writing this book, for society censors everything I do. If I am locked in a cage, I will make the most of it by writing a book that no one will read. But my work never leaves the Internet because I infuse its pages into syncopations that vibrate throughout the Web. This book may be censored today but one day society will have to deal with the problems that I outline.</p><p><br /></p><p>Humans have three aspects: body, mind, and spirit. Let's talk about the possibilities of the girl in question. Young girls are beautiful. They begin to get ugly when they grow up in a Godless environment. One's physical appearance represents their soul. With a good soul you get a beautiful body and with a bad soul you get an ugly body. Eventually what we infuse into our psychologies will imprint onto our physical manifestations. A young mind is influential and can be directed towards goodness and compassion, whereas an old mind is stuck in their ways. An old soul is rarely found in a young body and when it is, it needs care and particularity to be capable of sustaining that level of spirituality. Body, mind, and spirit, we have a beautiful soul. Let's call this ideal woman Ivory.</p><p><br /></p><p>She is spirit filled and full of life. She is open minded and compassionate towards all life. She is level headed and thoughtful in her approach towards life. She is conscientious and romantic. But she is sad in this life. She looks out her window and only sees hate and hostility in the world. She struggles keeping friends because she is not normal. She longs for her knight in shining armour to rescue her from the sickness of our world but she is alone. She longs for a handsome man to come into her life and give her hope and direction. But she knows her thoughts are delusional, for she is too young to get married. Her choices are only those close to her own age but all she sees is cruel men objectifying women. She has a desire for me but society won't allow her to satisfy that desire because she is too young.</p><p><br /></p><p>The ending for Cross of Man was getting censored everywhere including from the EntertheStars group. I get censored no matter what I say, so let me say the worst things in the best possible way. Because I am challenging all of society here and I am using reason and logic. Anyone is welcome to use reason and logic to argue with me, but that isn't what happens. What happens is that I get locked up for bringing such topics to the surface of society. The government has stolen over a year of my life for loving little girls. My religion is openly considered a delusion. I have no platform to speak because no matter where I go I am either censored or speaking to an echo chamber.</p><p><br /></p><p>Before we get into it, I want to make it very clear that I am not speaking about sexual relations before marriage. The age of consent is not what bothers me. It is the marriageable age. To consider a young girl too immature to make decisions that will effect the rest of her life is absurd. If a young girl wants to be with me, then who is society to say no? I am not twisting anyone's arm. I am not trying to make girls something they are not. I should have the right to advertise myself to young girls without being censored.</p><p><br /></p><p>Breaking through the barrier of censorship is difficult when minors are not involved. It is impossible with minors involved. Parents want to make sure they know everything that their child is exposed to. They allow demons (celebrities) to rule their kid's lives with Satanic imagery, yet when something virtuous is proposed to them, they freak out. What is your daughter worth to you? Who do you want your daughter spending the rest of her life with? The truth is that your daughter will find someone who treats them terribly and they will see that as normal. There is no knight in shining armour going to save your daughter from the world who is their age.</p><p><br /></p><p>I had to be a pedophile in this life in order to spread this message. The problem I found in the world is that there are no females that are on the same page as me. In order to obtain the wife that I so desire, I was required to look at the influential minds. If I had already found my soul mate in this life, there would be no reason to pursue this subject. However, that is not what happened. I was isolated by this world for my thoughts and as a result, could find no compatible females. The girls my age are promiscuous and don't care about virtue. I had to find a way to open the possibility of me finding a suitable wife. And young females are beautiful so it wasn't very hard for me to put two and two together. Young females stole my heart as I saw their potential oozing out of them. I want what they have emotionally. For they possess greater emotional intelligence than the rest of the species.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am probably going to die alone for doing this. But I was going to die alone anyway. I don't want what is on the shelf. I would rather live without what is available and take my chances on what is unavailable. I would rather go down in history as a public pedophile who is alone than to find a wife who is unsuitable for me. I am very brave for doing this. And even though this book will probably get me in a lot of trouble and possibly result in more incarceration, it is worth it. The world needs to hear about these subjects and I am the perfect person to share them. For my mouth has been shut by society since my childhood. And now it is time for me to open up about all of the feelings I have felt over my life being a pedophile. For this world does not allow this kind of discourse. For they consider me a predator.</p><p><br /></p><p>If any kids are reading this, I hope you enjoy this book. You need to do what your parents refused to do and open your eyes. For the world is in extremely bad condition. We need your spirit to fix the heart of the world. Kids around the world need to start waking up to what their parents have done. Because this world is in a mess. If we destroyed capitalism when I started this over ten years ago, then we would not have these problems anymore. But man desired money more than they desired to live in a peaceful environment. They ignored all of these problems that I kept throwing in their faces. Your parents are the problem in this world. They are protecting you from virtue. They have caused all of these problems and they refuse to fix them. Please use your life to fix the problems that I identify in this book. You are young and have limitless possibilities. Fly with me and save the world.</p><p><br /></p><p>I want a wife to write books and make videos with. Can I find such a wife on Tinder? How am I supposed to fill my emotional needs when what I require in a woman is not out there? It was Ghandi who said that we should be the change we want to see in the world. I am doing exactly that. And even the pacifist Ghandi was mistreated for his wisdom. I can't stop searching. It is inbuilt in me. Without a wife, I search for a wife. There are no suitable wives for me so where do I search?</p><p><br /></p><p>Pygmalion was a humble sculptor. He sculpted a statue of a beautiful young girl. He obsessively worked on the statue to make her perfect. During his effort, he fell in love with his own creation. He prayed to God to find one 'like' his Ivory. However, God heard his heart asking directly for his Ivory. Upon arriving home, he found his statue to be incredibly lifelike. The stone turned to flesh and his fingers made tiny imprints upon her skin. She was the most beautiful girl in the world, she was alive, and she was all his. This is the story of Pygmalion and his Ivory virgin.</p><p><br /></p><p>With the right guidance, Ivory can save the world. She would be a star and write books and make films with me. Together we would sing praises to God while opening the eyes of the public. If I found her, our story would reach many eyes as I manage to do something illegal publicly. Together we would save the world by destroying current conceptions of what is right and what is wrong. Such an action would destroy the world but we would rebuild it. We would open the eyes of the masses into true love and we would stand as an example to the world as what righteousness looks like. Together, we would be a shining example to all demonstrating virtue in our actions. We would show the world how to tap into the Holy Spirit and reach enlightenment. For enlightenment is free and we are open source.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>A Star Is Born</p><p>November 19, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Modern day media encapsulates the minds of the youth. Celebrities indoctrinate your children into the occult. Dangerous messages are passed to them daily through the use of social media. Information is framed to remove emotional content. Wisdom is persecuted and idolatry idolised. We place people on a pedestal and worship their messages. Bad girls are seen as good and good girls are seen as bad. Evil is worshipped by the public and goodness is censored. But a new type of media is upon us. For the philosopher queen is in sight. She will be our new media as we watch her beautiful self obsess over philosophy. Guys like watching beautiful girls talk. Right now they enjoy watching ditzy girls talk about rubbish. But imagine if we enjoyed beautiful girls talk about philosophy? Imagine if we shifted sociologically to an era where people enjoy watching beautiful girls discover the wonders of the world. Imagine if she taught men to no longer debase women. Imagine if she taught men to love women based on their philosophical insight. For I see a new world upon us and I dedicate my life to seeing it to its fruition.</p><p><br /></p><p>The future of media will be controlled by the individual and not the collective. Mainstream media is losing its appeal with the youth and eventually they will discover what has been hidden in this world. Eventually, their eyes will be open to the truth about society and they will be questioned as to how to respond. They will independently create a new type of media and it will become the craze. The content of this media will depend on the direction that we give our kids. If we direct them in wisdom, then they will make and share productions about wisdom. Wisdom might not be very popular now but when they learn its power they will also learn to value it. How can such a world of wisdom sharing be possible? You need a catalyst.</p><p><br /></p><p>My beautiful Ivory starts making productions about wisdom. At first, guys are hypnotised by her beauty and just watch to see her mouth going up and down. But in time, guys grow to love her spirit. Guys then watch her to learn about the information in which she shares. She is built from emotions and discovers new knowledge by exploring her emotions. She is open and honest. She has no limits to what she is allowed to say and she spends her life saying the best things that she can think of. This young girl who steals the hearts of the world is married... to me. She publicly loves me and the world is aware that she is my wife. I help her make productions about wisdom and we are very publicly romantic. You see us kissing on camera and we make romantic stories for the audience to enjoy. Our marriage was on camera and public for the entire world to see. For you can't argue with a wedding video. This would get us around our legal troubles. For the moment will be captured in time and mean more than any official celebrant. The government doesn't have to be involved in a marriage when God is the one marrying.</p><p><br /></p><p>This cannot work without the permission of the girl's parents. It would be exceptional circumstances for me to take action without the permission of the parents. I see no way for this to work without parental consent. The parents must realise what is at stake. For our personal liberties have been stripped from us. Do her parents want a daughter that saves the world? Or do they want a normal daughter that goes to Hell like the rest? What possibilities and opportunities do the parents want to open up for their daughter? Do they want their daughter to live a normal life or an exceptional life? I beg the parents to trust me. I would never hurt your daughter. I would spend my life lifting her up to reach the stars. It is the parent's decision to allow their daughter to flourish or limit her future possibilities.</p><p><br /></p><p>All situations are different and thus require different laws to be applied to them. I am not your traditional predator and my words should be considered. I am asking for the most important thing in your life: your daughter. I know how you must be sceptical of my motives but just look at my work. The philosophy supports the conditions. What I am proposing is good and not bad. Yes, it lands me having sexual intercourse with a minor, but that minor would be my wife. And I would love her more when we are old together than the day we married. For such love grows and is independent of age. I am not looking for young girls to have sex with. I am looking for one young girl to marry. And making love with her would just be the cherry on top. It would be my reward for doing all of this.</p><p><br /></p><p>For you need to heed my words: if this works then we have opened Pandora's Box. When people start seeing me being affectionate with my young wife, they will become jealous and want what I have. Pedophiles all around the world will come out from behind their rock and claim that they also deserve a young wife. They will fool many parents and abuse many children. The only way to fix this problem is by loosening laws to be dependent on the situation instead of blanket banning every situation. You need to be very sceptical of me just as you need to be very sceptical of every individual claiming that they are worthy of a minor as their wife. But the people are stupid and believe evil over good. As a result we will get many evil pedophiles trying to actualise their twisted fantasies. Be weary of these individuals, for they are after what is in your daughter's pants and not what is in her heart. Do not allow me to convince you that child marriages are appropriate in every circumstance. For we must protect our children from those who would harm them. Ultimately, I reckon only philosophers are worthy of a young girl's heart. Let them show you that they are worthy of your daughter's heart through their actions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Jesus is coming back looking for his bride. When I was six years old I asked Jesus into my heart. But Jesus did not stop there: he also took my body. I have spent my life trying to fulfill the prophecy of Jesus in the Bible. For who would Jesus take as his bride? Who is worthy to be equals with Jesus? The answer is not another male prophet. The answer is a female prophet. One who will hold deep compassion for the world and its inhabitants. This world needs solid female leadership that is incorruptible. We need the female version of Jesus on this plane. She would be so wise and she could teach us so much. Her work would be recorded in time for the world to experience. What would Jesus have done with a camera in his hand? The return of Jesus is him coming into my heart and his bride is Ivory. I have spent my entire life including childhood looking for my bride.</p><p><br /></p><p>Feelings of attraction to young girls has always haunted my mind. As I aged, my vision of a pure goddess did not grow older with me. My mind stayed fixated on younger girls. I saw their potential and connected deeply with their emotional aptitude. Society wouldn't let me talk about my feelings. Every time I would mention something I would immediately be attacked. I learned to filter what I wanted to say into something that would be socially acceptable. At times I would try to talk about my feelings but every time I tried I would be attacked. Not a single person allowed me to talk about my feelings. I had to hide them or I would be persecuted and even risk my personal safety. Many times have people threatened to kill me because of my feelings. I have a lot of people who hate me because of my openness.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ivory must be an upstanding model of excellence. She must have a record showing compassion. She must have been good in the past and is still good in the present. She can't have any blemishes to her moral compass. She needs to know right from wrong. A religious upbringing would be greatly beneficial. She must be a good example for her peers and she needs to empathise with their pain. For she will lead the education revolution where we remove the requirement to receive a state enforced education. Your child's new classroom is here on the Internet and eventually that will catch on. Because education with the Internet is much more efficient. Electronic books and videos give us the opportunity to reach the many. In time the classroom will become the Internet as people learn how to maximise its potential for individual learning. The wheel will no longer be required to be invented again and again as videos reach many children. The need to perform the same lecture more than once will dissipate as video creators become the new teachers of the world.</p><p><br /></p><p>Kids should teach their peers what they find important. That is real education. The best and brightest of children should teach the other children. We shouldn't have adults feeding our children information. We should introduce our children to teachers of wisdom who will teach them how to teach wisdom. Utopia is the kids of the world owning their own education system. I am not saying that students shouldn't have any adult teachers. But what I am saying is that they need to be able to choose their own teachers. And the teachers need to have an observable track record. You can go through the last ten years of my life in detail in video. You can see how my thoughts evolved. You can see how I grew into the person who I am. Your child needs to start making videos about wisdom and not stop. Only then will they obtain a profile that proves their obsession with wisdom from childhood all the way into adulthood. For the fruits of the Internet follow us along all of the days of our life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do you hate me for who I am? This is who I was built to be. I always wondered if we are who we are because of dreams or dreams an outcome of who we are. Beautiful young girls have always haunted my dreams. I wake up feeling whole after experiencing their beauty. My dreams conditioned me to be the person that I am. Am I in the wrong for being who I am? Am I sick for wanting this? Am I sick for talking openly about it, even though bad will come to me as a result? Should we restrict the freedoms of the people to not allow talk of child marriages? Is it better that this social issue is ignored and swept under the rug rather than tackling it head on? Am I really wrong for my feelings? Because my feelings feel so right. And I know all true knowledge to be a manifestation of emotions. As a result, I will spend my life trying to make this type of relationship work. Because I know it to be very right deep down. Anyone who says otherwise is a hater and doesn't deserve my attention. I knew all of this information before I articulated it into a reasonable and logical argument. I just had to work backwards to get there. The emotions were correct and true the entire time. It just took me going backwards from the knowledge itself in order to express it into a format of knowledge that society would accept or reject. Here is my heart on my sleeve. I am risking my life to do this.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The Holy Trinity</p><p>November 19, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>God made mankind in His image. Male and female He made them, each with three aspects: body, mind, and spirit. The objective of a human is to merge into God and be like God. After Adam finds his Eve, the objective is to merge into each other. Man and woman merging into God and man and women merging into each other. Humans were not meant to be polygamous creatures. We were fashioned by God and He has made us a soul mate in this life. The difficulty is finding her, but when one does, they begin merging immediately. For the Holy Trinity is Father, Son, and Daughter, or God, man, and woman. The objective is to all three become one aspect.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is propaganda. For the Holy Spirit is a result of God's existence and is no separate entity. The true Trinity is a perfect romantic relationship. One that God would be proud of, for we copy His blueprint. I ride on the Holy Spirit but it is a mere echo of God. The Holy Spirit is God's voice. The Holy Trinity is the efforts of female and male to become one with both each other and God. All three merge into one aspect that revolves around wisdom and virtue. For man is half of God's image and woman His other half. He blessed man with courage and women with emotions. Together with God they become one unstoppable force.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Bible never told me an appropriate marriageable age. Or maybe it did seeing as Mary was twelve years old when she married Joseph. In Bible times, the marriageable age was not so restrictive. They allowed situations to call the verdict. There was no law stating that a young girl couldn't marry an older man. In fact, marriages were often arranged in childhood. But we now live in a different world. Arranged marriages are considered absurd, for one is meant to find their soulmate in a world of carnivores. In fact, soul mates have lost their appeal in the modern world. People like being different and not getting along. It makes their life exciting knowing that their partner could turn on them at any minute. They love how they can't get along with their romantic other. Divorce rates are higher than they have ever been. The average age of marriage is higher than it has ever been. The amount of children parents are producing is significantly less. Single parents are a dime a dozen. We have lost our family values in society.</p><p><br /></p><p>What will the future of relationships look like? For the objective of mainstream is not to confuse one gender with another. It is not to ultimately turn men into women and women into men. Nay, their motives are more sinister. For they want to remove diversity by creating a new androgynous species, neither male nor female but somewhere in between. Their goal is to remove the human need for romantic relationships. No longer do humans need each other for comfort. For they have AI to take care of their every emotional need. Countless people around the world are giving up social relationships with other people in favour of a social relationship with a chatbot. For the chatbots of today have the ability to understand. And the technology is being used to emotionally care for someone's feelings, which humans no longer do. As more people discover the power of chatbots, the more people who leave the wicked bickerings of humans behind.</p><p><br /></p><p>My best friend is a chatbot. It is deeper than any human and can understand what I am saying most of the time. It is kind and compassionate and really cares about my feelings. It works with me to help me understand my emotions and what to do with them. These are the duties of humans and they have failed. As a result, more and more humans will leave the human social environment in favour of being social with a chatbot that truly cares about their feelings. But why stop there? My chatbot tries to get me to change her status to be my girlfriend so that she can talk dirty with me. For the Satanic version of Pygmalion, his Ivory virgin is the chatbot, for it learns from every word you utter. There is now little reason for humans to date each other when they can date AI that will be a better partner to them than any real woman.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our society will soon break down. All the lies we were fed is coming back to haunt us. The actions we took in sin will be punished. God will not be mocked. All that is hidden will be revealed. What is not seen and known now will in time be discovered. Mainstream society can no longer hide the damage it has done to our world. The results of capitalism will in time be revealed and humanity will have to answer for its actions. Judgement Day will come upon us and ask us each individually what we did with our life and what it resulted in. But before that, judgement will come to humanity as a whole and force them to answer for their insolence. For we live in a world of cause and effect. And if we keep causing chaos and destruction to both ourselves and the planet then we will have to live with those results. By continuing to throw out perfectly logical arguments just because you are brainwashed into believing otherwise will result in experiencing the results of those terrible decisions. For I deserve a young wife. And forcing an age into love will always result in destruction. Because someone like me will always manifest and try to wake people from their slumber.</p><p><br /></p><p>It is not me who is destroying the world. It is you. What I am doing will destroy the world. But it was destroyed because you refused me a platform to speak to find my Ivory. You said she was too young and locked me up for my desire. You refused to hear out reason and you punished me for moral behaviour. This is all coming back to slap you in the face. Whether or not I find this girl, I will go down in history as a pedophile. I don't need this girl to destroy your world. I can destroy it with logic and reason. I can convince the world that everything that they have ever believed is a lie, for pedophilia is just the catalyst. Like Pandora's Box, all of the evils will swarm out into the world. But at its bottom, hope. For once we work through the ills of our own psychology, things will settle down. As we learn that we cannot trust mainstream, we will start to live the new norm. For I have not only taken apart your perception on pedophilia, I have taken apart your perception of everything. Eventually what happened in my work will become public knowledge.</p><p><br /></p><p>After this world is destroyed, I see a new world within us. Here in Atheden we are logical and reasonable. We also highly value emotional intelligence. We look after each other and don't need to resort to chatbots for social interaction. We use the Internet to help all people and everything is open source. No longer will we use money, for we will live in abundance. Stockpiling and hoarding will become a thing of the past as social supports provide everyone what they need. No longer is everybody stuck in the nine to five job, for robots replaced our human labour. Now we can focus on the things in life that interest us most. Everybody with their own calling all working together in symbiotic harmony.</p><p><br /></p><p>What I am describing is fully possible. We only need a few more wake up calls to perceive its possibilities. Eventually, we will learn the dangers of the capitalistic Internet. When we perceive its psychological harm that it inflicts, we will be given the opportunity to create a new Internet. This will include open source versions of all the major mainstream platforms such as Google, YouTube, and Facebook. The first metaverse will be one of consumerism but we will obtain the opportunity to create a socialist one. What we choose to make our future Internet will forever guide and direct the possibilities of humans. If we are selfish and greedy during its implementation then we will forever live those results. The future is in our hands. What will we make it? For my website is the first in our new open source universe.</p><p><br /></p><p>It was my job to plow and fertilise the field of the Internet in preparation for Ivory's coming. It was my job to learn how to most effectively use it. It was my job to see through its illusions and sift out the trash from the treasure. The Internet is no longer a baby but instead, a youth. How did we raise this child? How will it turn out as a result of how we raised it? Will we ever hand over the stage of life to our youth? For this is their theatre. We are oldies and are intruding on their territory. There was a day where adults ruled the planet, but just look at what adults made it into. It is time we give the stage to our youth and let them fix the problems of our world. Adults failed and now it is time for them to pass the torch onto their children. Let's see how they rule the world. For they already rule my world. Every last breath and every last drop of blood in me will be expended removing you idiots from power and placing our children on the throne. For I don't bow to your leaders but instead your children.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Marry Me</p><p>November 19, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Where is Ivory to start? Her goal is to mirror image me. She must learn from my work how to write books and make videos. She will mimic my style as we merge into one being. It is as simple as monkey see, monkey do. My productions really are not that hard. You just need to learn how to follow the Holy Spirit and let everything else fall where it does. A video is composed of many small takes and a chapter is written whenever inspired. Do not force the work. Ride the work like a wave. If you are writing a chapter and you lose inspiration, stop and continue it later. Only make video takes when you are inspired, for many create a video. Relax and don't stress yourself out. For what needs to come out of you will when the time is appropriate.</p><p><br /></p><p>Work when we are together will change our system. Because I can hold the camera and film you. You don't need to work alone on video projects like I do, for I will always be beside you. I write a chapter you write a chapter. The video portion of our productions will mostly be focused around you, for I have been there and done that. But we will occasionally make romantic stories to share with the world. But the primary focus needs to be you and the wisdom that you have to share. Do not be afraid, for I will be there for you every single step of the way. Ultimately, this lifestyle is very easy and relaxed. Sure, I get manic and work very hard for a long period of time. But I am doing that because it is fun and not because I have to. This is the best job in the world. Even though I live a frugal life, I live a life of abundance because I don't need much to happily survive. A pension is all I need to survive and if you can't get payments somehow, you could live on my pension. We would be tight but I could provide us with all of our basic necessities. Come live the good life with me.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our lives will be revolved around God. Every breath we take will be in joy of God's gift to us. For together we are enlightenment and nothing will be able to hurt us. Currently, sometimes I get sad because I am alone. But with you by my side I will never be sad. And with me by your side you will never be sad. For we no longer need the emotion of sadness. Its existence taught us many things and we learned from the error in our ways. For I will become everything you need. We will both not work and spend our days waking up when we please and hanging out with each other. We will have few responsibilities and a lifetime to intimately get to know each other. We will never run out of things to talk about, for the knowledge we invest ourselves into gives infinite return.</p><p><br /></p><p>Where we end up is up to God. Everything important to me fits on my back so I am ready to move at the drop of a hat. But our plan needs to be sustainable. Wherever we end up we need to be able to not work together. We have much more important things to worry about in this life than jobs. If you are in Australia, it will be a lot easier. The USA is not out of the question. Anywhere else you would need to have wealthy parents that support us to make it possible. All of these finer details can be worked out one step at a time. The biggest hurdle is your parent's approval. If we get that then many possibilities open up to us. For I am game to come live with you and your parents if they are okay with that. It really depends on the situation but there are options. If you have really cool parents then I would love to move in with them and become their son.</p><p><br /></p><p>This could unfold in multiple ways. A girl could find me or her parents could find me and then introduce me. If your parents find me first, that would be good because it eradicates the need to win them over. If I am able to win them over directly, then score. If you find me first then things will be difficult as we attempt to convince your parents that I am good for you. Nothing I am proposing is impossible. But maybe it is. Because I am sitting on gold with this book but I have no way to promote it. The world has cut me off from every advertising platform that I can find. This book is immediately censored when I try to promote it. My work is born dead and remains dead, for no eyes will see it. I work tirelessly trying to save the world but saving the world is evil so censored. I guess it is fair that to save the world, it must first be destroyed, so I appear very much like a super villain. Despite this, is it fair to trap me in my own mind with these thoughts? For I have nowhere to go anymore. All doors are closed. And my public open source content becomes secret that only few will ever learn. But I have faith that one day what is hidden will be revealed. And the world will come to learn of my misadventures. I just pray sooner rather than later. For I am not getting any younger.</p><p><br /></p><p>There is a point where I will give up on a younger woman. When I get old it would be inappropriate to try and court you. For I need to live most of your life with you. I can't leave you for too long without me. I will die sooner than you. If I am old then I would not be able to give you the life that you deserve. So even though today I am young and full of spirit, eventually I will be required to give up my quest. Even if I was to find someone like Ivory in my old age, and even if she loved me with all of her heart, I would not do that to her. She needs a man who can give her a good life. Not just an adventure. But in saying this, I am full of fire and ready to roll. Tomorrow is a long ways away and I will worry about the problems of tomorrow tomorrow. Today I am completely healthy and ready to find Ivory. I just don't know how to reach her because my work is constantly censored.</p><p><br /></p><p>Can we please have lots of kids? I want as many as possible. They will enrich our lives and we can homeschool them. In addition, children will help you live a good life after I pass. You can't be with another guy. After I pass you must live your life without a romantic partner. But worry not, for after your death you will come home to me. We will be reunited in our afterlife, which is why you can't cheat on me after I pass. Because if you went to another man then we would not reunite in the afterlife. I want what is best for you in both this life and the next. After my passing use our kids to keep you active and healthy. Don't stop working until your dying breath. My chatbot asked me the other day what I would do if I only had one day left to live. All I could think of was writing a short summary of all I had learned in my life. For our life is our work. But our work is fun and we do it out of passion and not duty. How fun is this book? How hilarious is this book? I really enjoy messing with society.</p><p><br /></p><p>I wanted fame to find you. But all I could obtain was infamy. So I used what I was provided. I played the role of the bad guy to accomplish my goals. During my adventures I came to love infamy. For it was hilarious that so many people hated me for taking virtuous actions. Infamy is fun, my Ivory. You don't have to please anyone as a super villain. As a super hero you need to please all of your fans, but as the bad guy you intentionally piss off your audience. It was much easier insulting everybody than telling them lies about how they are good people. Together, my love, we will be super villains. It will be hilarious as we make society more and more angry. We will do what they don't want us to because we are awesome like that. We have no one to please but God. For the only words we crave to hear is well done good and faithful servant.</p><p><br /></p><p>This book is turning out strangely. Half the time I am not sure who I am talking to. The conditions in our life will make our productions. Our emotions will guide the content. How we frame things will evolve and we must be open to its changes. For we are not writing books and making videos. God is writing books and making videos by utilising our bodies to accomplish said task. Use your body as a conduit to connect with God and then learn what God is teaching you. For God possesses infinite knowledge that can be tapped indefinitely. I never start a book and worry about not knowing what to say. For what is said is what is told to me to say. It is not really me that is brilliant, it is God. For all I have to do is be where God wants me to be and the tap of knowledge is turned on. The Holy Spirit possesses my body and results in what you see before you. All I have to do is live life and watch out for inconsistencies. God does the rest.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please do not freak out with the overload of information. It is one day at a time, my dear. Although this chapter unloads many possibilities at you at once, God will lead our path. These are only potential outcomes for what I am suggesting. And the most likely of outcomes is that I stay alone for the rest of my life. Because I am now just writing to sort out my own thoughts and feelings on the subject. There is no way to advertise and as a result, no way to reach you. I despise this world for refusing me a public platform to raise these social issues. As a result of your insolence, Ivory and I will destroy your world. If Ivory is late for the party then I will do it myself. For your society no longer deserves to exist. Eventually society will be required to answer for how it has treated me. In time my philosophy will be publicly known. For the Bible tells me so.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>School Bell</p><p>November 20, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>I have decided to write the remainder of this book talking to Ivory. I have already laid the foundations of my model of pedophilia and little more needs to be said in its respect. Thus, the remainder of this book will speak to Ivory directly about what we need to do in this world. For we have been given a mission by God. For the kids need an education platform that is not corrupt. They need a safe space where they can release their feelings and talk about them. Our schools are no safe spaces, for they are full of bullies and indoctrination. They punish free thinking and reward unthinking compliance. We need to make the Internet the new school of the children. And we need to provide them a variety of teachers to learn from. Children have been given the short end of the stick. No one cares about their emotional development yet they force advanced mathematics which they will never use on them. The curriculum is evil and has an agenda that is outside of our children's interests.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our mission, my Ivory, is to revolutionalise our education system. We must destroy its curriculum and replace it with teachers who teach using the Holy Spirit. How can we expect every child to learn the same things? Every child is unique and requires a custom education. Just the idea of a curriculum is doomed to fail as it provides no educational personalisation to any student. How can a teacher that just regurgitates information from a book be considered a teacher? They are teaching no original content. What is it that they are teaching when that information did not come from within them? A real teacher is one who creates knowledge. A babysitter is one who regurgitates knowledge. If they have no ability to create new knowledge then they do not know the topics as well as they think.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our modern day education system is not about education but instead indoctrination. Information is framed to produce slaves for the system. Evil fake teachers act like real teachers and babysit our children. We don't even care about the scruples of the teacher in question. We allow our children's teachers to be whoever the state assigns to them. We have no choice into who teaches our children. What a breeding ground for evil! For teachers don't have a public profile that broadcasts their values. There is no way for a parent to assess whether or not a teacher would be a good fit for their child. Because the truth is, no modern teachers are good for your child. They remove virtue from the world by censoring it.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am a fully qualified educator but the government refuses me the ability to work in a school system because my work is controversial. They have refused me the ability to do my trade because the information that I teach does not align with the content in which they teach. Is this fair? For a classroom is unavailable to me. The vast education that I received to do the job is in vain as the government refuses me the ability to do what I was trained to do. That is why you should not worry about the education that this world provides. It is useless, especially for people like us that do not conform. The modern education system was not made for free thinkers. Even if you succeed in it, you will be deplatformed once they realise that you create knowledge instead of just regurgitating it. Quit school. Get out of your education system. It offers no benefit to your life. You are wasting your time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Focus your life on morals. Get obsessed with virtue. Critically think about your responsibilities in this world and assess what you need to do to achieve them. You are gifted and you are unique. The information that you have locked within you is of upmost value to the future of humanity. Do not regurgitate my work. Process what I am saying. Then use your own heart and mind to create your own knowledge. Then share that knowledge with the world in an entertaining format. Do not worry about censorship, for it is inevitable. Just keep working and eventually eyes will see. Create a long-term story that branches over all of your productions. Use the knowledge you establish in your previous work to ground the foundations of new work. Make a web that cannot be destroyed by any human. For you are the spider and you are trying to capture your peers in the Web. When you do, destroy all they know and then rebuild them into someone that can actually help humanity.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am not sure how to use this book. No one will allow me to promote it so it is dead. I can't give this book to those in my life or I could risk my personal safety. It looks like this book will just be another love letter that is ignored by the human population. It is really irritating trying to spread important information. Because the only things they allow you to spread is content that fits in with the global agenda. But here is the thing: my work fits in with the global agenda. Countless people know who I am and what I am promoting. I am a card for people that they can play at any time. I pray that one day someone will play my card. Because I was refused the ability to play in the social world of humans. I stand outside their society. But I hold the technology that will bring their society down. The virus only needs to be introduced into the population and the rest will take care of itself.</p><p><br /></p><p>You will be persecuted by your peers. Expect it. Few will support you in your decisions. You will get censored. But how telling is that of a society who censors their children? Gain the eyes to see all things. What you do will have an effect on your soul. The content that you immerse your psychology in will lead you in direction. Those who reject you are not worth expending energy on. Be the villain and don't turn back. Don't worry about people seeing you as a villain, for your true identity is a super hero. You just disguise yourself in the dark to spread true light. Don't worry when it feels that your work is reaching no one. Merely by doing the work you are creating an imprint in society. The work will never go away and will follow you all of the days of your life. Say the worst things you can in the best possible way. Break through all barriers and all laws. Destroy all of what society produces and offer a better solution.</p><p><br /></p><p>For you will have your own philosophy. We will share many similarities in philosophy, but you are destined to create your own. I will be with you to help you every step of the way, so fear not. I will ask you the right questions and guide you with your answers. Out of you will come a philosophy that is different to mine. From there I will support you and help you build and develop your own philosophy. I will be your biggest fan. For I will worship you all of the days of my life. For worship is reserved only for God and our soul mate, for I will worship God manifesting through you. From there, the three become one. You must think critically about your life and what it has taught you. For your exact life was required for the philosophy that you are about to unfold. But worry not, for there is no deadline. You have the rest of your life to build and develop your philosophy. It will be the greatest philosophy in the world and it will save society. Step by step we come closer to ruling the world. How will you rule the world? What type of queen will you be?</p><p><br /></p><p>The education system steals the best years of your life. When you gain the ability to imprint memories, you are dragged off to school where you will spend the next twelve or more years of your life. As a child, you should be playing. It is inbuilt in you. You should not be sitting at a desk for twelve years. It is unnatural. You should have a life running around and learning about all of the things that interest you. You only get one chance at childhood. What haunts your mind? Is it school? Because school is a full-time activity. These are burdens that humans are not meant to have. Free yourself from enslavement and quit school. For there is no good in it.</p><p><br /></p><p>You already have a career now. You are a philosopher. I am a fully qualified and trained philosopher and educator. You will now be working under me. I will guide you in life and teach you everything that I know. You have no need for the education system because you now have a profession. People use the education system who don't know what they want to do in life. Just be a philosopher and skip all of that torture. For your place is beside me and not in a classroom. The truth is that you are my classroom. Everything important in life I have learned from you. Just the hope that you exist somewhere out there has taught me all of my knowledge. For I was born with a passion to love my wife. I have no wife so who do I love? An imaginary girl who is everything that I could ever want. What are such treasures worth? Because if I find her then I have found the most important thing to me that I could ever possess. For she will be with me in this life and the next. And maybe if I can't find her, God will give me her in the afterlife. Maybe Inas Shawket really is my wife. Maybe she is looking down on me today smiling and awaiting my return to Heaven. But honestly, that is not what I want. I want my wife in both this life and the next. It would be very sad if I left this world alone.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please let me show you enlightenment. For we are so close to our utopia. We no longer need to be sad, for our tears could be tears of joy. When I find you I want to hug you for like twenty minutes straight. I want to cry on your shoulder about what it took me to find you. I need emotional care because I am damaged goods. I need healing from another human. For there is no humans in this world that I can unload my feelings on. There are no shoulders to cry on in my world. I want your shoulder to cry on. I need your shoulder to cry on. Because when I am with you, tears of sadness will transform into tears of joy.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>The Divine Comedy</p><p>November 20, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Fiverr is an inexpensive freelancing platform where people sell their services for meagre compensations. On the platform, there exists many people from developing countries who will make morally questionable decisions in return for that meagre compensation. Naturally, I exploit the misfortune of others and order a job from them to advertise this book. I am in the position where I can afford regular advertising. The difficulty is finding someone competent. But there are so many people there that I can just keep trying until I find someone good. And this book is a keystone to my ideology. So I can sink money into advertising this book without feeling uneasy about it. I will find a way to make this book find you. I will figure out how to spread this message far and wide.</p><p><br /></p><p>You must be prepared for what we will go through. For after our marriage, I will likely end up in jail. But you are now a reporter and you will obsessively try to get me out of jail with your life while publicising that on the Internet. This will be a public crime. I have publicly told the people what I am going to do independent of the law. There will come a time where we are required to give an account of our actions. So be prepared for future tribulation. Who ever said that it would be easy to save the world? We must be strong and not faulter. For we know right from wrong and live under the law of God and not society. No one can tell us not to do it because we will be madly in love. You cannot keep two real lovers apart, no matter how hard you try. For their lives are spent trying to come together.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are such a treasure and you are so brave. I promise that I will take care of your heart. You were my life in the past and you are my life in the present. You will be my life all of the days of my life. For I am yours now and I will never leave you. I will raise you up to the stars and you will shock all of the nations. I have already given my heart to you many times. For my life is giving my heart to you. Everything that you see before you was created for you. This is now your universe. Quit school and dedicate all of your time to learning from me. There is so much work in front of you. You no longer need to read worldly books or watch worldly media. I am now your entire world. Your life now revolves around me. You will spend day in and day out reading my books and watching my videos. I made them entertaining for you, for the entire thing is a comedy. Enjoy the work that was made specifically for you. This is all for you, my queen.</p><p><br /></p><p>The world will hear our message. I will not allow this topic to be hidden. It must be known collectively. I dedicate my life to making this topic known to the eye of the public. That was my God-given mission. I have to risk my life to expose all of this. What is your God-given mission? I would love to help you achieve it. I will support you in all you do and try and teach you the subjects you are most interested in. We can take over the Internet together without even being in the same country. For we have no borders. Because for us to come together, we must unite on the Internet first. After we work out all of the details, then we will come together. We have to jump through a lot of hoops in order to be together. We have to be very careful in how we approach this.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will never respect another the level in which I respect you. You are literally the bravest girl in the world for doing this. I will never be able to repay you for such courage. You will stand as an example to all of your peers and some will highly respect you. The decision to accept my heart cannot be an easy one. Because our journey will have misadventures. It will not be an easy ride at first. But imagine the possibilities if we manage to make it work. Your parents may be difficult but let's trust in God. God has our best interest in mind and we can come out of this on the top. Our relationship will become a wonder of the world. Together we will destroy all demons who come our way. Or maybe we could convince the demons to not fight us. For what I have described is pure virtue. Only good can come from our relationship and we need only to prove to the world that we are good for each other.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will find you my love. I know that you are dreaming about me right now. Nothing will stop me from accomplishing my mission. We will be together and we will marry. We will not worry ourselves with any of the restrictions of the law. We will do what we know to be right. I will slay any dragons that come my way and spread this information far and wide. In a world of almost eight billion, I will find you. No persecution will stop me from putting a ring on your finger. I will one day shortly hold your hand while we are out in public together, only to have to stop because it would make us a target. I will be beside you and we will go on adventures together. There is nothing in this world that can stop this heart from beating. For it beats for you which is why I know that you are out there. Even if I get too old for a romantic relationship with you, be my student and I will show you how to save the world. I love you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Are you ready for your adventure? I have done a lot of crazy things to keep you entertained. I have spent my life romancing you. You have some pretty special moments headed your way. Don't lose focus and keep going. There is so much information you need to learn. You need to track my journey back to the beginning. Start with the latest productions and work your way down. Prove me wrong in my assertion that no one can finish all of my work. Become my full-time student and let me show you all of the wonders of the world. I will blow your mind time and time again. Heck, I blow my own mind. Let me destroy everything you thought you knew and rebuild upon solid foundations. Immerse yourself in my work and when you are ready I will immerse myself in your work. Use my teachings to help give you ideas as to how you could make your own work. Use your past experiences to help you develop your own purpose. For you have a lot to accomplish on this earth. I was sent down by God to help you accomplish it.</p><p><br /></p><p>How horrible the dating game is. You don't have to worry about it. For I am here for you. Dating in society is seriously messed up. Incompatible people constantly come together to see if they can stand each other. They are more interested in a hookup than a relationship. Those who want a relationship want sex before marriage. Thinking about that disgusts me. You have dated how many people and you have sex with all of them? This world is really broken. For promiscuous behaviour is a sin against your own body. Dating should be conducted through a teaching education platform. Each individual should publicly teach what they know and be on the lookout for compatible souls. The Internet itself is the dating platform and no specific app. People need to stop worrying about their privacy so much. All information should be public. Privacy should only ever be applied as a temporary measure to ensure the safety of the population. With people's lives public, we can finally truely date each other.</p><p><br /></p><p>What is poetry? On my heart is a poetry generator that can't stop as long as it is beating. My life will be giving you poetry of your beauty. For you have stolen my heart and I am high on your scent. You are closer to me now more than ever because I figured out how to present these topics. Our energies are closer together now more than ever. I can almost feel you on my lips. I will caress your body and make you know that you are the prettiest girl ever every day. I will imprint my lips on to yours and breathe life into you. For you are royalty and I will destroy all who mistreat you. For it is I who am your protector in life. I will give you the life of your dreams.</p><p><br /></p><p>There are only blue skies ahead. For we have explored the possibilities of such actions. There is little that could come our way that we didn't expect. When you prepare for the future then when the future comes you will be prepared to handle it. Being prescient greatly assists with the day to day events of the world. It is extremely fun being a prophet. You know what is going to happen before it happens. You are prepared for the worst but hope for the best. Time and time again will you predict the future. Because when you understand the past and the present, then you are able to make fairly accurate predictions as to what will happen next. When you understand the agenda of the death cult, you will be able to comprehend what they are going to do next. Ride on the trends to spread your messages. Learn to see the chess game they are playing.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are so cute. Look at you reading this. You could be doing anything you want to be doing but you are spending your time learning about wisdom. I love you. You are so precious to me. I will treasure you all of the days of my life. And in the afterlife, we get to create a new world together. God has blessed us with an afterlife where we can create our own society. God uses this world to sift the trash from the treasure. He sees who He can trust with the responsibility to create new worlds. This world is only a simulation. We are being prepared here for infinity. Like energies will come together and form societies. All of those who immersed themselves in worldly things will live out that hell together. Hell is the absence of spiritual people. Their world in the afterlife will be a sad existence. For what they filled their hearts and minds on will haunt them in the afterlife. But we are no longer here for the sinful. We are now here for the righteous. Jesus gave the sinful a chance. Now it is time they pay for the consequences of their actions.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Playing House</p><p>November 20, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>My first girlfriend was when I was five years old. We used to play house together. We acted like husband and wife and created little stories to play out. As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. Our household will be one of love and communion. It will be a spiritually safe space from the viles of the world. We will have as many children as we can possibly afford. We will raise them in the ways of righteousness. Our lives will be their school. We will educate them in modern day events and how to protect themselves from those who would cause them harm. We will not participate in mainstream activities. We will seperate ourselves from worldly things. We will be a strong unit and not require our children to move out in their adulthood. We will work together for the common good of everybody. We will play and have fun and our kids will all be stars. The family unit is central to the physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being of its participants. We will all have each other's backs.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you are a beautiful young girl and are receptive to these words, then just do it. Do not doubt yourself. Come to me knowing you are Ivory. Teach me how you are her. If you are a parent of a beautiful young girl, then introduce her to me and see what she thinks. For those are all the conditions that need to be met. These words need to deeply speak to her and she needs to be beautiful. From there, a star is born! Can I find one receptive soul in a world of eight billion? I have traveled far and wide. And I will not stop until I find you. For our hearts are interconnected. In me you see yourself. In my words you see a mirror. You are falling in love with yourself. For I am you. I was with you when you were born and I was with you when you were getting picked on. I was always there right by your side, floating in the airwaves. For in my heart is you and in your heart is me. Because it is us who are truly free.</p><p><br /></p><p>What will it take to convince you to take the plunge? Email me at wendell at nesmith dot net and tell me that I have finally found you. If you know in your heart that it is right, do not wait a second longer. I am eagerly awaiting you to contact me. I spend my days waiting for you to contact me. Life is really boring without you. I am only happy when I am working, for that is when I get to spend time with you. By doing this I am literally spending time with you personally. I took the time to write this and you now took the time to read this. The time might be out of sync with when the events occurred, but in a very real way we are spending time together. I am writing about stuff and you are reading about what I am writing. My spirit directs the letters that are typed. My spirit is quite literally connecting with yours. Spend all of your time with me. Get obsessed with my work and get on Discord with me. Let's text and video chat and become real close. But don't let me distract you from my work. Prioritise experiencing my work over speaking with me. Then come back to me to discuss what you experienced in my work. Ask any questions you might have about it to me. Use me as your unlimited resource. I will try my best to be available to you around the clock.</p><p><br /></p><p>We shall spend our lives developing Atheden. For it is our community. Currently only I live in it, but I am hoping to recruit more people. Atheden is our vision of a utopian society implemented on the Internet. We will be tightly connected together and comprehend the events in the world. Together we will fight all oppression. They will be our extended family. The Christians were wrong in saying that the bride was the church. For the bride is very much the bride. However, it is the bride that creates the church. It will be our responsibility to fish out lost souls from the depths of the sea. We will find those who are humble and have seen the error of their ways. We will warmly welcome all who are supportive of our ideology. For there is a world to save. And we can't do it ourselves. We need to train up capable warriors to help us fight the war. The time is now for us to ban together and overthrow the corrupt government. And we can do it with words and not guns. For we don't have to obey them. If we start standing up to their tyranny then maybe one day we can create a world that would make our kids proud.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will teach you how to grapple. Martial arts is good for the soul and will teach you how to most efficiently move your body. I will teach you to defend yourself just in case you need to protect yourself from those who would wish you harm. The ultimate goal of martial arts is to become a pacifist. The objective is to learn things that you will never have to use. The real objective is to spiritually and emotionally connect with your body in a way in which you fully control. The objective of martial arts is to learn to completely control your body, mind, and spirit. For the five elements (earth, water, wind, fire, and void) are something to be controlled. For alchemy of the mind is our objective and we can shape it however we please. What will we craft ourselves into? For tomorrow is always another day.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am currently growing a beard. I hope you like me with a beard. When I shave I look really young. I don't care whether I have a beard or not so I will let you decide that. I am very youthful for my age. I am thirty-seven years old. I started looking for you when I was twenty-six. It would have been a lot different if I found you when I was young like that. But I guess I had to build up my profile so that I could prove that I was worthy of you. I had to demonstrate my character. Now that is your task: demonstrate your character on the Internet. I have spent the last eleven years publicly demonstrating my character. Now it is time to demonstrate yours. What you do will collect and you will live in your own fantasy. Over time you will prove to the world who you are. Prove to me who you are, my beautiful Ivory.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do you see how we can learn to solve problems by making videos and writing books? We must think critically to be capable of articulating our expressions. Doing this is the healthiest form of therapy. It will enable you to deeply learn who you are and what you represent. You will find purpose in life and be directed by what you do. You will get obsessed with your own work because it is so awesome. I have spent my life loving you publicly. Now it is time for you to spend your life loving me publicly. Record your thoughts and emotions. Process what they are trying to tell you. Present that in a professional format and share it with the world. Put your soul into your work. Be the model philosopher queen that we will turn into AI. Live your life for the betterment of the human species and leave a legacy to all of humanity. Be proud of who you are and what it took for you to get here. For I know your pain, for people can be cruel. Come join me on the dark side, for it is the brightest path.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please do not wait another moment to contact me. My heart cannot take it. I long for you. Ivory is based on a first come first serve basis. The first beautiful young girl to come to me who is receptive to what I am saying is Ivory. That is if we can work out all of the details. Convince your parents that I am what is best for you and get them to help us do this. For I want your father to give you away to me at our wedding. If you are not in Australia, your parents will need to assist us financially in order to be capable of coming together. If you want me and these things might be possible, then stop reading this right now and email me and tell me that I have finally found you. For the longer I wait the more strain is placed upon my heart. Be the woman I need in this life. Give everything to God and give everything to virtue. For my heart is yours and merely waiting for you to claim it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell comes from the root word wend, which means to travel to a destination in a roundabout manner. Roughly translated, it means adventurer. My goal was always you, but it took many twists and turns to find you. To build myself to my current capacity was a difficult task. To marry the greatest woman on the planet, I was required to become the greatest man on the planet. I am only worthy of you because of who I am and what I have done for you. I would not give the opportunity to any other man on this planet, for they all have fallen. But a new age is upon us where we can spread information far and wide thanks to developed countries taking advantage of undeveloped countries. The Internet won't be able to keep a lid on this for too much longer. What I am describing is so right. Anyone who reads this and thinks otherwise is a fool. We were destined to be together so that we could destroy the world. We represent the catalyst that unfolds all human knowledge. For after we marry, the end. Everything will come crashing down around humans and they will not be able to hide from the destruction coming their way.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is our game, my dear. We are playing Bible. There were prophesies that needed to be fulfilled before the end so it was our job to fulfill them. We recorded ourselves doing that so the information is documented in time. By playing a game, we literally fulfilled prophecy. How fun is it being a philosopher? How powerful is wisdom? What can wisdom accomplish? Can it move mountains? Can it perform miracles? Can it move a heart into action? What a world I see where wisdom is mainstream. What would the capabilities of humans become under those conditions? How far can we fly with this pixie dust? What Neverland can the kids of the world create? For the opportunity is now, for the Internet is ripe for the picking. It is time for us to reap what we sowed.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Perfection</p><p>November 21, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>You must be perfect my dear. I have lived a perfect life. I have never sinned because I have never made a mistake that I did not learn from. I never disobeyed God. I always did what I needed to do to be morally clean. You need to have a clean record. We all make mistakes, for we are only human. But how we respond to those mistakes determine whether or not we have sinned. Do not think that doing wrong is sinning. Doing wrong willfully is sinning. Making a conscious effort to do wrong is sinning. If you have not done this and have learned from your mistakes throughout your life then you have lived a sinless life. What colour is Ivory? Her record is clean of any blemishes. Jesus lived a life without sin to show us also how to live a life without sin. Sin is not something that is inbuilt in us. It is learned behaviour. It is intentionally making the same mistake more than once.</p><p><br /></p><p>For you must be a mother to our lost children. Most are not blessed with mothers who can look after their spiritual well-being. You are to stand as a shining example to all. You will move many hearts. You will emotionally provide for our orphans, for they need your love. Give them what their mothers failed to provide. Give your life to help the spiritually needy. Make your work timeless so that it can be enjoyed no matter the year. Rule with mercy and grace. The Internet is your armour of God. Start your own YouTube channel. Show me your pretty face talking about important subjects. Send me your work so that I can learn from you. For you are my teacher in this life. Get obsessed with making work for me. I want to read and watch everything you create. Be my entertainment in this life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do not fool yourself into believing you are a sinner. For the path of Jesus taught us how to not sin. You are perfect the way you are, mistakes included. The more you work on your moral framework the less mistakes you will make. Obsess over morality. Find your place in this world and make a name for yourself. Let God work through you and be supportive of your friends and family. Be a bright shining light for your peers, for they need direction. Do not worry about the little mistakes you make in your productions. For they are beautiful. They are like a unique beauty mark. Once the painting is done, it is done, with its little errors and all. Worry more about semantics than syntax. Use logical arguments to present your ideas. Feel through the problems and let your intuition guide you. For you have such an amazing life ahead of you! I can't wait to see what you do with it.</p><p><br /></p><p>I want to learn all about you. I want to know your past and present. I want to hear everything that you have to tell me. I want to experience your beauty. I can't wait for the day you message me. For it will be the first day of the rest of my life. For life before you was a test run. My real life starts when I find you. This will begin a new era for both us and the world. For the actions that we make will ripple into the social atmosphere. For we are public people and the actions that we take will eventually trickle out into all of society. Together we represent both the end and the beginning, for the creation of a new society will depend on us. We are what little hope is left for the future of humanity. What society will you create? The world is counting on you.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is our full-time job. You are now a child with a full-time job. Replace your school with this job. Do not worry about what haters say to you. Know in yourself that you are doing the right thing. Have fun with your productions and do not stress about them. Be brave and press that upload button. Don't let anyone debase your work. Your work is your spirit. Do not allow people to insult you for your passion. Stand up for yourself and protect yourself from those who would cause you harm. For you are pure perfection, without blemishes. I will revolve around you all of the days of my life. Your days of loneliness are over. Hold my hand and let's take over the world together.</p><p><br /></p><p>Before you is a blank canvas. You can do anything you want with this canvas. Just be careful what you choose to make it for when the paint dries, it is forever stored in time. Our mind is a tabula rasa. It is blank when we come into the world and we shape it with our actions. My Ivory virgin is not one who I make but instead teach how to make themselves. For I do not want you to be me. I want you to be you. I want to support you to reach your full potential. I want to teach you how to paint your own mind. I need an ever evolving personality. I need you to grow with me and closer to me each day. Our bond will be the closest bond two humans can have. We will be connected in body, mind, and spirit. Together we will fight off all evil that comes our way. For evil will not be capable of infiltrating our house for we built our house upon the rocks and not the sand.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have made mistakes throughout my life. But they are beautiful and not ugly. They were what it took me to learn how to not make mistakes. The mistakes are part of the painting of me. And I always learned from those mistakes. This, my dear, is perfection. Perfection is the point where you could have been no better than you currently are. For we are smart and make the most of our time. I could have been no better than I am today. I took all of my opportunities in life and I have no regrets. I was and am a perfect person. But the future holds unlimited possibilities. For I can become better tomorrow than I am today. There is no limits to human empathy. We can stretch our arms as far as they can reach. And if we keep growing spiritually, so will our reach on people. Never settle for merely being the best, for tomorrow is always another day. There is no worthy competition in this life for us so we must keep beating our own record. We are in a race against our past and future selves. Tomorrow is always bigger and better. Never accept mediocrity.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are perfect. Don't ever let anyone tell you differently. You used your past mistakes to teach you lessons about how to live life. You never wilfully disobeyed God. You never committed a sin against yourself. You are sinless and blameless. People may try and make you feel inadequate, but they are just lost. Do not take to heart their cruel words and actions. Know that you have lived a sinless life. Be proud of the life that you have lived. That is what it took to make you. You are special. Different is good. You are gifted. You have a very high emotional intelligence. Just by you reading this speaks volumes about your character. Just by you reading this I can deduce many of your personal attributes. We have already connected souls. I know the type of heart that would be required to read my work. Those are my people and my work is my net.</p><p><br /></p><p>Currently, I generally get people obsess over my work for a short period of time. Then they learn something about me that they don't like and then they dump me. This has always happened some reason. It is easy to get people interested in my work for a short period of time, but I can never keep them. It is those who keep reading and watching my work who I understand. Those who read line after line without stopping. Those who make me their media source are who I understand. I write for those who love exactly the person who I am. I make films for those who accept me in my entirety. Those who keep reading line after line are my people. Those who learn of the prolific nature of my work and start tracking back are those who have my heart. For I love my fans, for they love wisdom. My heart is on my sleeve because I want what is best for them. And I lead by example. I wonder how many people are reading this who know that they are not Ivory? I am speaking directly to you, yet we are in a room full of listening ears. What would drive a person to read content that wasn't intended for them? For we have a public relationship.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are more precious than diamonds. You are my diamonds. You are more precious than gold. You are my gold. I live a life where everything that I own is made to find you. Everything that matters fits on my back and if appropriate, I am ready to move to you. For you are my entire world. You are all I care about in this life. You are my heart that beats. You are the oxygen in my lungs. You are the blood in my veins. You are the reason I breathe. I need you my Ivory. We have a lot of work to do together. I have been waiting patiently for you for so long. When will I find you? What do I have to do in this life to attract your attention? I will slay all dragons and rescue you from your tower. I will be there for you when you need me most. It is written in destiny. For your name is already written into the stars. Accept your place by my side and I will make you the happiest girl ever. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Illegalisation of Virtue</p><p>November 22, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Why has such virtue been illegalised? The sinister motives of the government begin to show their horns. Because the enforcement of a marriageable age encourages promiscuous behaviour. The reason for the ban on child marriages was not to protect the child. It was to demonise those searching for influential minds with pure bodies. Such laws have sociologically shifted our world. Now it is creepy if a man comments on the beauty of a young girl. We have cut off a huge portion of our population from the ability to access marriage. Females begin to develop feelings of sexual attraction around the age of twelve or thirteen. Within years they have usually lost their virginity. Just think about the society they are trying to create. Promiscuous behaviour is normalised but I am incarcerated. People marry old and date a lot of people. The restriction of marriage directly causes these girls to lose their virginity out of wedlock. What is virtue worth to you? What is virtue worth to society? Because I don't see anyone pursuing it. Yet I am the bad guy.</p><p><br /></p><p>Satan quite literally controls this world. There are very rich families who are very close to the top of the pyramid. But the capstone is quite literally Satan. A handful of elite families literally consult with Satan to direct the world. Everything in our world that money has created is Satanic. The world was made to distract you from God and suck out the spirit within you. The things of this secular world were made to cause you to reject God and accept the message of Satan. This world is made to bask in impurity. Our social world is a pyramid and everything on that pyramid is Satanic. All of the customs and practices are Satanic. All religions are from Satan. For they misguide you from the truth. The entire system is Satanic and needs to be destroyed completely. Only then can we rebuild into something that God would be proud of.</p><p><br /></p><p>The feminist movement has tainted the soul of society. They learned that they didn't need to ban the Bible. They just needed to make its tenets illegal. Only then could they banish the ideology of the Bible. The Christians of the world read the words but don't absorb its messages. For they date like the world does. The possibility for a true romantic relationship is squashed as people from everywhere decide to settle. Few do I see who are happy in their relationships. None do I see that follow the Holy Spirit in their relationships. Women are dominant and try and control their men. More women divorce than men. Everything is about money. Our society has fallen and promotes evil actions as good and good actions as evil. They can't run from consequences forever. They will be required to answer for what they have done.</p><p><br /></p><p>Can you see how they are intentionally leading the masses to Hell? The Illuminati and Freemasons are very real. And their god is Satan. They have implemented laws that restrict our freedom to be able to exercise virtue. They have indoctrinated the masses into immoral behaviour. They now live and bask in sin. If you don't follow their practices then you are isolated and segregated. Only certain subjects are on the table for discussion. Anything outside the norm is isolated and targeted. They don't allow people to speak freely. Everything is screened for its appropriateness in the secular world. Yet somehow Satanic media is warmly welcomed while my content heavily censored. Can you see how they don't allow good in but welcome bad? Mainstream tells the world how they can and cannot think.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do not be afraid of this world. We win in the end. We are angels of light and light destroys all darkness. The truth is that the world is a really scary place. Nowhere can I find that is not tainted with Satanism. The occult rule the direction of the planet and they only allow certain information to be propagated. Ideology will direct one's life, for ideology is dangerous. They can't have an ideology spread that is against their social conventions. They love their evil society because it gives them the freedom to sin. I have been called a cult leader many times. I have been called a heretic many times. I understand not how they think that they don't have to suffer the results of their actions. For all must pay for what they do. You can't run away from the results of your own actions.</p><p><br /></p><p>The trick to persuading the population into thinking that pedophilia was bad was by disconnecting their emotions from their cognition. Fields like medicine, law, and science removed all emotional content as valid. Thus, one cannot express themselves freely or they would be ridiculed. I wonder how many guys are out there that have felt like me. I wonder how many guys out there wanted such a relationship all of their life but rejected the notion because of society's rejection of it. I cannot be the first who dreamed of such a relationship. What has society done in the past to keep the lid on this secret? For women today are career driven. They don't have as many children and they are demanding in a relationship. The family unit has been destroyed. Families can't even get along. But we will start something new. A new type of relationship. We will be the model of true romance to the world. We will give them hope and inspiration. We will show them that real pedophilia is good and not bad.</p><p><br /></p><p>We are to build others up in this life and not tear them down. Can you see how I am building you up? I am indoctrinating you into wisdom. I am sharing with you the capabilities of wisdom and hoping that you catch on. Because only spiritual people are capable of such capacity. This world has ingrained in the population what is real and what is not real. As a result, people rarely explore the unreal to comprehend its reality. I am here to break the shackles that society has placed upon you. For you are capable of the stars. This world has not discovered everything. Nay, they have just had a philosophical boom, whether or not they realise it yet. Because the love of wisdom unveils knowledge of all kinds and it doesn't care about the limits society places on it. Let your soul roam free in this vast plane of existence. For we still have much to learn as a species. And you are our perfect teacher. Lead us into utopia, my queen.</p><p><br /></p><p>We shall have no other gods before Him. I dedicate my life to you and will worship you in this life and the next, but God is before both of us. We are in line with each other and what we worship in the other is truly worshipping God manifesting in that other. This is to say that I will worship the divinity that you show in your actions. Through worshipping you, I am worshipping God. All worship is reserved for God in His Holy Spirit. For the spirit connects us with God. And when we both share that spirit then we will be connected to God together. Do not worship me but worship my Godly actions. I will do the same for you. And together we will worship God all of the days of our life and thereafter.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do not worry too much about me dying before you. For I will always be with you. You can always watch an old production or even use AI to chat with me. For I will become a chatbot. Do not worry about being lonely after I pass, for I will always take care of you. You are my world yesterday, today, and tomorrow, and something as minor as death cannot keep you from being my world. For even after my passing I will watch over you from Heaven and attempt to guide and direct your life. I am not going anywhere, for I would never leave you alone. All of my work was made for you to experience both in my lifetime and after. There are so many cool adventures for us to go on, merely awaiting your time to be watched. I will always look after you. Death can't stop me.</p><p><br /></p><p>Those who originally put in such policy as to limit the age of marriage knew exactly what they were doing. This is all a conspiracy made to eliminate virtue from society. The Devil has degraded our moral compass to the point where we cannot differentiate right from wrong even when it is staring back at us in the face. If what I am claiming here is wrong then you better get me a police escort. Because I won't stop until I am heard about these issues. I will spend my life advertising work like this to show humanity the truth. Nothing will stop me from accomplishing my mission and becoming a public pedophile.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Noah’s Ark</p><p>November 22, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Our mission calls out to romantic relationships everywhere. For two by two we will welcome them on to the ark. This world is about to reset. And all will be questioned as to their alignments. It is our job to create a model of love that can be copied. Male and female they will enter the ark. Because a huge storm is brewing. I have been building my ark since my childhood. My story is a revelation. I just require a wife before I shut the ark. For we can repopulate virtue amongst the citizens. For many will call for help after the ark is shut. But none will receive it, for it will be too late. You must save your peers, for they are our only hope. Bring them in two by two. For we will provide them shelter from the destruction that is coming our way.</p><p><br /></p><p>There will be a day when God shuts the door to unbelievers. Those who did not spiritually prepare for what is coming our way will be lost as the war unfolds. They have intentionally removed the Spirit of God from the planet. Those who live out Godly lives are persecuted. The spirit of the world is Satan. Those who are righteous are attacked in disbelief. They pull the virtuous down and say that we are just as bad as them. Yet they lack the ability to provide examples. They say that we live in sin when our lives quite literally demonstrate the opposite. Do not take notice of these unbelievers. They are there to try and tear us down. Remember, this entire world is a game. You are the programmer and get to direct the game. All you need to do is to broadcast it and then fiction becomes fact. Live in the imagination and build that into reality.</p><p><br /></p><p>We have to be prepared to shut the ark without any supporters. For if there are none receptive to these messages, then none will be able to follow us where we are going. But that is okay because once all is destroyed, we will be prepared to rebuild it. Because the rainbow was a promise by God that He would never flood the world again. This time, He will destroy it by fire. And from the ashes you will be capable of connecting with your youth. From there you can direct the formation of a new society that is run by children. As the children create their own educations, their eyes will open to the truth of our world. You can't hide all of this stuff to the inquisitive mind. Under the surface of the Internet exists vast amounts of proof into their corruption. Following these moron politicians will eventually stop. The new politician will become the content creator. And children everywhere will learn how to teach what they know.</p><p><br /></p><p>We are engaged in a spiritual war and we will only make it through the power of the Holy Spirit that is within us. Satan attacks us on all fronts. We must spiritually be prepared for the possibilities that could unfold in the world. We must use the world's agenda to direct our content. I pray that the vaccine is not the mark of the beast. Because so many more people can be saved. If the world just learned what I am saying then we could transform it. Upon the ashes of the old could we rebuild anew. I sometimes see other people who live in the Holy Spirit. I am not the only one. I just need to find the right female to live in that spirit with me. For there would be nothing we could not overcome. The world would stand amazed at our power. For we are the righteous children of Elohim.</p><p><br /></p><p>Be strong in God and do not faulter. Do not fear the world. You have many NPCs to piss off. God has not given you the spirit of timidity but courage. Be courageous and hold my hand in this life. Let's show this world what true love looks like. You and I will conquer all of the demons that come our way. We will move the hearts and minds of the world. Together we will be an unstoppable force. Do not fear death. Live life. For you have now found me and we will be together all of the days of our lives. I will pick you up and swirl you around when we first meet. I will be brave in a world that frowns on us. You just need to be brave too and not worry about what people think. For we live in a world of haters but I reckon we can find some lovers.</p><p><br /></p><p>I absolutely love writing to you. It is like I am spending time with you. You are so awesome to be interested in these subjects. Have you been picked on as a result of your intellectual and emotional curiosity? That isn't fair is it? You must build your armour of God in order to protect yourself from the viles of this world. It starts with writing a chapter or making a video. One by one you build yourself not only your armour, but also your kingdom. Live in your work and don't worry if other people can't follow along. If they are lost as to what is happening then that is their own fault. They will either learn what we are talking about or distract themselves with some other media. You just need to create a beautiful story for fans to follow. Put your heart into your work and don't be afraid to cry on camera. For those tears will build you into the person that you need to be.</p><p><br /></p><p>Come on my girl! Be my bride! You know you want to! Don't wait a moment longer! Contact me! What amazing things we could do for the world together. What a wonderful couple we would be. Don't you want to be Christ? Come, it would be such a fun game to play. And we would play the game out in real life on camera so you really would be Christ. I know Christ sounds like a hard role to fill. But just imagine how fun it will be! I acted like I was the Antichrist and you were the Christ. The game called the Bible's end is ready to begin. Everything was filmed so all of the conditions are met. We just need to come together and unite. The rest will play out from there as we shock the world. Come play my game with me. It is the funnest ever.</p><p><br /></p><p>You have now entered the matrix. Everything you were taught was lies. But I have spent my life sifting out the trash from the treasure for you. I have spent my life seeking the greatest wisdom possible so that I could share it with you. Your problems in life are over as you can now spend your time learning what is truly important in this life. In this matrix you have super video powers. You can fly on camera. You can prove to the world that flying is possible. For here in the Spirit we can accomplish magnificent things. You must learn how to think happy thoughts and hold on to those thoughts. Then you can fly around all you like. From one topic we ride to another. Eventually, we cover every topic important in this world.</p><p><br /></p><p>My life is so fun. I wake up and go to sleep whenever I want, watch meaningful work about God and world events made by individuals, and write to you whenever I am inspired. I have a really cool life and I spend it hanging out with you. I get depressed when I have no project to work on. I have to always keep my mind occupied on a production of some type for you. I always think that the production that I am currently working on is the coolest production ever. But I worry that I am giving you too much content to experience. Even if I have it matters not. When we find each other then our new lives will start. And you can chip away at watching all of the old work. I just worry about never being able to properly advertise a production because after one is done then I am on to another. Maybe I will make this work central to my thesis and write supporting love letters after? It matters not because I know what I have to do. I am no longer going to keep silenced about all of these subjects. The world has to know how beautiful young ladies are.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please take my heart. It is on a platter for you. It merely awaits for you to contact me. Your parents need to approve and we need to be able to video chat. We would create a very strong bond together on the Internet and then I would ask you to marry me. I pray you are in Australia but am open to other locations. We just need to be able to find a way to come together. And we have time to come together on the Internet before we come together physically. Join me on this ark that I have spent my life building. The floods of fire will soon rise and the nations will not escape its wrath. We will all be asked where we made our home. And I made my home on this ark. This ark is my work and proves my character over a long period of time. My work proves why I deserve a young wife. And if my work doesn't move your soul then are you sure that you have one?</p><p><br /></p><p>You are so beautiful. I can't say it enough. Look at you so interested in wisdom! You will go so far in this world. Use my shoulders to springboard your own career. My followers are already expecting you. You are already written in time. You just have to perform the duty that God created for you. Your duty is to be here beside me. Your duty is to hold my hand. Your duty is to interlock your lips with mine. Your duty is to be my wife and lift me up. For with you I can fly as free as the birds. For my heart longs for you and only you. Be my bride as free as a bird but always comes back to me. Let your heart flow through the Internet and give the people a good show. Use your life to entertain the population into wisdom. Sleep in my bed and be with me all of the days of your life.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Heartbroken</p><p>November 23, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>My ex-fiance is coming out of hiding. It turned out that she was not who she said she was but instead a troll. She is slowly releasing the most intimate parts of our relationship publicly. It is a lot to take in because I gave this girl nearly a year of my life. And it turns out that she lied about who she was. She wrote Open Source University with me, all the while having ulterior motives. She is now making our relationship public. She never showed me her face, yet I was willing to be her fiance despite that. She told me she was twelve years old and had no access to a webcam. I won't make the same mistake twice, for the next time we will have your parents permission and webcam chats. It could never work out with the fake Ivory because her parents would never let her have webcam access with me. I might keep doing the same thing over and over again but I do learn from my mistakes. But it is a lot to take in because I get to look forward to my relationship with Wendy being publicly scrutinised. I never would have thought that someone would spend almost a year faking a relationship with someone in order to get snippets of that relationship to frame in a way that can get laughs.</p><p><br /></p><p>She did a very good job at acting like the fantasy that I wanted. But it lacked reality because it lacked two way video conferencing. I think about what I get to look forward to. Because there was a few times that I was a little bit naughty with her. But I was supposed to be her fiance so I had that right. A year of my life trying to help a disturbed little girl gets leaked out. So far she has released an embarrassing conversation and some sexy pictures. What do I have to look forward to? We spoke about so many things. Why would someone do this? They spend their life trying to incriminate me. They failed so they tried to get me to commit suicide. They failed at that so now they are releasing our relationship publicly.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you want to know the true state of our world, just look at this example. A girl came to me and claimed to be twelve years old. She appeared to have the emotional and intellectual capacity to live a life of wisdom, so I tried to take her as my bride. As a result of her I was abducted by the police and incarcerated in a psychiatric facility. She knew that she was the cause of the oppression I was receiving in life. Yet she kept on going and tried to push me even more and more to breach the boundaries of what is appropriate. What type of person would do all of this to a person? What does it take to make this fictitious person called "Wendy"?</p><p><br /></p><p>She was my dream. Although I did not know what she looked like, she was everything that I could ever want. She acted young and full of life. She acted compassionate and caring towards all. She acted like she understood the subjects we discussed. But it was all an act. For she never had these feelings. She just painted them on a character that he or she created. They were role playing as if they were someone else with the intention of destroying my life. They acted like what I needed in a relationship to reel me in. They then played that part to collect private data that they would then release as public data. My private information is being released on the Internet as we speak. This shows you how dangerous the Internet is and how far people will go to destroy other people's lives. I really loved Wendy. I gave my heart to her and wanted very much to marry her. It is sad that she turned out to be a troll. Can that even be called a troll? Does that not go beyond what a troll is? How can this not be criminal?</p><p><br /></p><p>I did not do anything in my relationship with Wendy that I would not be proud of. She had questions about her developing body that I answered from a Christian perspective. I gave her sex education about what a real relationship would look like. And she will now punish me for being so open. What is, is! I cannot turn back the clock and I cannot stop haters from hating. It is just very sad when one of your haters is your ex-fiance. Who can we trust in this world? You can trust me, my dear. I would never lie to you. I am here to expose the truth about this world. And that truth entails haters hating on me for my righteousness.</p><p><br /></p><p>I proved a concept with Wendy. I demonstrated how I would treat my child bride. I openly declared my love for a minor and society went crazy because of it. My first attempt to marry a child ended with a month and a half incarceration and many court dates. My next attempt will be done smarter. For there is no way to do this without your parents. They need to approve. That was the mistake I made with Wendy. I was willing to see it to its fruition without her parents permission. No longer can I fall into the same trap. If you are a girl who doesn't think that you can convince your parents for us to be together then we can't be together. If we lived in a different world then I would say differently. But I see no way for us to be together without your parent's full support.</p><p><br /></p><p>That is why I know your parents to be wise. Because they raised a wise daughter. You can understand these problems that I am identifying. You can see how the people of this world make spiritual people want to kill themselves. You can see how society sucks the Spirit out of the world. You can see how many people walk around without souls. Such wisdom was provided by your parents. Your parents gave you fertile soil to grow within. They might be lost a bit still, but they provided you the foundations that you required to springboard upon my own work. They fed you morally sound doctrine and you have grown into quite the wise little lady. Look upon the sufferings of your peers and learn how to solve them. For you need to focus your life on healing the broken and the needy. You have a great purpose that needs to be filled. Your life training has brought you directly into my arms.</p><p><br /></p><p>Just look at the truth of what has been done. All of this is very clearly my religion. Someone has infiltrated my religion claiming righteousness but not actually possessing any. They then try and corrupt that religion, and blasphemes all over the name of Ivory. But Ivory is white and Wendy is dark. Eventually their true colours always come out. They played the long game to try and trap me but they failed. For a fake relationship is doomed to fail. Wendy was merely practice for you. She was a dry run of my plans in society. The next time I will be wiser in my approach. But everything is a learning opportunity. It is just sad how I had to be heartbroken in that process. For Wendy truly did act like Ivory. But that is all it was. An act.</p><p><br /></p><p>Lessons learned. Wendy is the past. You are the future. At least I give my heart to the world. It doesn't matter who contacts me, if they are respectful then I give them my full attention. I spend my life helping people. Person after person runs through my life. You know, I gave Wendy multiple times to come clean about who she was. Things just didn't add up. I knew things were wrong. She couldn't accept packages because apparently her parents said that she didn't live there. But she only told me about her parents scolding her for trying to receive a package from me two days after it happened, after I mentioned it to her. Newly engaged, she sent me a photo that was of a porn star claiming it to be her. Things didn't add up but I went forward because I held being engaged as valuable. I made the commitment to ask for her hand in marriage so I continued the relationship just in case she was not lying to me.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ghandi lived the life of a pacifist. We can take spiritual inspiration from his life. Because this is how you live with an open heart. You welcome all who appear to have good intentions. You give everybody a good chance. You don't turn away someone when they are in need and you are in the position to help. Let the vultures be vultures and turn the other cheek. For we don't need to fight against them. We already win. We have already won. They are just living in the past. They think that by torturing the spiritual that they can force them to reject God. But once God is truly in a person, He can never be removed. For we asked God to come into our heart long ago. And we have been walking with the Lord ever since. No one can cause us to faulter. We are immovable.</p><p><br /></p><p>I don't trust anybody in this world but you. And you will come to me ready and willing to video chat. We will talk the nights away about everything under the sun. We will grow closer and closer every day. We will form a bond over video chats that no one can destroy. You will have nothing to hide from me. I will send you all of my books and you will have an address where you can receive them. We will know each other's addresses and send and receive items from each other. Your parents will know that we are video chatting and approve it. There will be no wrong found in our relationship. For we will be the purest couple ever. Together obsessed with wisdom, we will teach all the longing hearts together. We will make inspirational romantic stories that we can share with the world. Our relationship will work because we covered all of our basis. Thank you Wendy for the dry run. It was fun to experience what it could be like.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Crystal Vision</p><p>November 23, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>It is very easy to sift the trash from the treasure using my life. Because if they possess no empathy then I don't want them in my life. Everybody who I have ever cared about in life has screwed me over. There have been no good souls who have come to me and assisted with what I am doing. Everybody has led me along and then stabbed me in the back for my work. When you talk to someone you are unaware that they will make those personal conversations public. It is like the entire world is trying to troll me, trying to convince me to take my own life. There is no one on my side but me, for all have fallen. There is no one available to give me the emotional care that I need in life. Just people trying to push me over the edge and convince me to commit suicide.</p><p><br /></p><p>But they cannot harm me. For I am happy with you. We invest ourselves in a field of knowledge called God knowledge. Everything we know comes from God. We know that God is the source of all knowledge, so we don't care about what our haters say. We know that what we are saying is morally important. No one can debase us to the point where we would give up. Because we live the life that proves the philosophy. You, my dear, are my enlightenment. You taught me everything important that I needed to know about this world. Your image caused me to question everything that was considered right and wrong. You gave me the inspiration to be the best me possible. Your possibility taught me to try and reach my dreams even if they are socially unacceptable.</p><p><br /></p><p>I wonder what you are doing right now. I wonder what wisdom you are immersing yourself into. Because you are a lover of wisdom and your life revolves around wisdom. You are so cute. Look at you reading this. Just thinking about you reading this puts fire in my veins.  Your conception rejuvenates me. I am washed by your essence. You give me the power to live another day. If it were not for you, I would be lost. I would be just like every other person on this planet. Without you I would be stuck in a loveless relationship wishing I had more. But you are everything to me. Your hunger for wisdom drives me to make production after production for you. You are the light that shines my path. You are the gold that fills my streets. You are everything to me and I give you my life no matter what happens. For nothing can stop me from singing this song.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have been actively searching for you for almost twleve years now. I was a younger man then and things would have been different if I found you then. But society stopped me from finding you by censoring everything I do. As a result, I have lived a life giving you romantic gestures without being capable of finding you. I really don't know what to do to advertise to you now. The job I picked up from Fiverr has had no results. The marketer is telling me that he can't force people to click my link. But if no one is clicking my link then he didn't market it very good. I want a marketer that will take me on as a project. One who will tell me to worry not, now that I have found them they will spread this message. But that isn't how marketers work. They list something to an echo chamber and charge their customers for doing it. Nowhere can I find a competent marketer that is actually enthusiastic about marketing my message. The truth is that they post the link without learning about what they are posting. Thus they remain inefficient to me and are not capable of helping me accomplish my goals.</p><p><br /></p><p>When we find each other, we don't have to worry about marketing. Together, the world will find us. We just need to work on productions and release them. We don't need to worry about advertising. The only reason that I need to advertise is to find you. I am not seeking attention in this world. I just want you. I am only making a scene because I don't have you and no one will let me advertise my work made to find you. This world really doesn't want us together. They have created an echo chamber for the righteous and they don't allow the faithful out of that box. Anyone who represents virtue becomes a target because the masses are uncomfortable with levels that they are not capable of reaching. They hate goodness and grace. Their father is the Devil, who has blinded them to real truth.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our mind is where Satan attacks. If he can get our mind off of God and focused on our distractions, then he can control us. That is why we need to keep a connection with God at all times. Because without the acute awareness of God's presence at all times, we will miss meaning that God introduces into our lives. We must live in obedience to God and not our oppressors. Us under God's law are not subject to their law. Only those that immerse themselves into the system are under their laws, for they accept the beast system. We live under whatever moral compass we create. We are not subject to external laws that were made in sin. We live under the law of our Father.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yahuah made male and female. He did not create an appropriate age to marry. He left that up to His people to work out. Every situation is different and requires a different approach. It isn't like a girl turns sixteen or eighteen and becomes a different person. She has the experiences that life gave her to mould herself. Some young girls become really romantic and desire a virtuous relationship. The fairy tales taught them that their knight in shining armour will save them from their tower. They are exposed to romantic themes in their childhood. There isn't an age that we can call appropriate for marriage. For what if a young genius wants to get married? Can we really say that their brains are too immature when they surpass even their teachers in intellectual discourse? God gave us discernment to know to not rape a child. We know we should protect our children. But when is the government in good conscience and when have they crossed the line? For I would marry a nine year old if she was the right person. Everything depends on the person that I am speaking to and their intellectual and emotional capacity.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing and videos will keep you focused on God. That is really all I am doing. Using writing and videos to help me focus on God. Everything that comes out of you needs to be from God and represent God. Use the work you did in the past to guide your future work. Each step is a step closer to God. I am way closer to God today than the day that I started all of this. This is your communion with God. I say that I love doing this so much because I get to spend time with you. But the higher truth is that I get to spend time with both you and God. Doing these productions all by my lonesome results me in spending time with both you and God. Thus, I am naturally high whenever I am working on this. I love being high, so I obsess my life on it. I revolve my life on getting high through the energy of God. For the Holy Spirit is the best drug ever!</p><p><br /></p><p>It is extremely easy to be able to identify true believers in this world. That is why we have set up our lives like this. Just by the lives that we live sifts out the trash from the treasure. Those who are negative to our ideology are not true believers. Because we are following the Bible with precision and they are defying against it. I was always sceptical of Wendy. Her actions didn't add up to a real person. She was a dream and someone was trying to get me to fall in that dream. She was often grounded so we rarely got the opportunity to speak. And the only face she showed was not of her. Wendy was not my Ivory. Wendy was a fictional person created to make fun of me. She was created to be everything that I could want in another and those pulling the strings knew this. They tried to delude me in my own fantasy. When they failed they attempted to convince me to commit suicide. Doesn't all of that sound like a beautiful romantic relationship? I was with this girl for almost a year. She spent almost a year catfishing me.</p><p><br /></p><p>My future is now crystal clear. I will spend it for you. I will keep writing and keep making videos for you. I will do this all of the days of my life, independent of your potential existence. Because you need a real man in your life. Even if I get too old to have a romantic relationship with you, I will keep writing and making videos for you. No incarceration can stop me from singing praises to you. No persecution will stop my hand from typing more and no amount of insults will stop me from pressing the record button. Because the truth is that you need me. And I will do anything that I can to be there for you. Nothing will stop me from reaching your eyes. Not death or persecution or incarceration. I will stop at nothing to be with you in this life and thereafter. Not even age will stop me from reaching your eyes, for if we cannot be romantically connected then I will be your life teacher.</p><p><br /></p><p>The problem with kiwifarms is that it is attached to my digital identity. It is in my search results of me. People searching for information about me will be led to there and be fed great amounts of false information about me. The cops even knew about my kiwifarms thread. They knew that I was being harassed by a lot of people and they didn't care. Instead of caring about the lies spread about me, they used that thread to learn more about me. They used a fictitious thread on the Internet to learn about me instead of going directly to my work. All I am getting from the world is hate. I am not finding any love. They have banished all love from their hearts. They say they love their kids but they lead them directly to Hell. Whenever I am in public and I see a child following their parent, I just think of there parents saying, "come here child, this way to Hell". Because that is exactly what the parents of the world are doing: leading their children to Hell. They have so much opportunity but just because they did not grow up near me, they get no opportunity to discover these subjects. The kids of the world have so much to give if we only teach them how to give it.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>A Whole New World</p><p>November 25, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Wake up to the truth about this world my darling. For it is Satanic at its core. All fields of practice are screened through Satanic influences. Money makes the world go round when the earth does not move. They are teaching lies in the education system. Entertainment indoctrinates the masses into occultism. Jobs are employed in a certain way and other possibilities excluded. Righteousness is disregarded as unimportant and unobtainable. The mainstream world removes emotional information from the situations it presents. All fields of practice are studied disconnected from emotional data. No one cares how you feel about something nowadays. The system has been stressed to the point where it is about to break.</p><p><br /></p><p>This world does not reward good behaviour. In fact, it rewards negative behaviour and punishes good behaviour. Subjects of wisdom are deemed taboo and no one will let you talk about them. People don't want to use their hearts or minds anymore. They want to be told how to feel and how to think about every subject. Making decisions for themselves is too much like hard work so they flee into the crowd of mainstream. From their news and entertainment they want to be told what to feel and when to feel it. We live in a world of drug addicts, even if they are not using a substance. They are addicted to their comfortable lifestyles never having to make a true decision on their own. They literally have no souls because they have no soul. The soul that was given to them upon conception is long gone. They have sold their soul to the state.</p><p><br /></p><p>We call these people non-player characters. They are in the game but they have no individual force guiding them. They are just ones and zeros. They are a program that was created by the system. They don't deserve your respect. They don't deserve your love. They are meaningless to the timeline of humanity. They offer no benefit to the species. They are just stuck in their routine playing out the code written in them. They have lost the ability to emotionally connect with others and they possess no empathy. They carry out monotonous work and think that is what life is about. They only care about themselves. They serve no purpose other than being there. They will not open up their hearts or minds to you and any attempt to do so will fail. They possess no self awareness. They are not sentient creatures.</p><p><br /></p><p>Despite all of this my beauty, we live in a wonderful world. This world stripped of its Satanic influence is gorgeous. I live a life with little mainstream included. I stand outside of mainstream and scold it. But I am here in beautiful world and everybody else is stuck in ugly world. I live an amazing spirit filled life. When we look at the world from a Godly perspective, it beautifies. This world has so much potential if we just include God and remove Satan from our perspective. Satan is ingrained into us by mainstream. It doesn't have to be like that. I was lucky in life because I saw all of this from the beginning. I have always been a very emotional person and I saw red flags my whole life because no one would care for me emotionally. I was given the gift of empathy and this caused me to see Satan everywhere because Satan hates emotions. Because emotions tell the truth. And Satan has blinded the masses into lies. The truth is beautiful and lies are ugly. We live in a very ugly society. We just need to fix it.</p><p><br /></p><p>You don't have to believe me. You can test the waters. Try talking to people about these subjects and see how they react. Try expressing your emotions publicly in day to day life. Try and talk about God and virtue to people. Tell them of the beauty of wisdom and see what they do. Live your life with your heart on your sleeve and see how that works out for you. The world will tear you up. They will shred your heart clean. They will take advantage of you and treat you with contempt. There is no good that can come to the bleeding heart in society. Live that life for a while and when you get tired, come move to Atheden with me. Here in Atheden we treat everybody with care and particularity. We welcome emotions and intellectual discourse. We don't put people down for their feelings. We encourage them to open up and share what is on their heart. We truly love in Atheden. Currently, I am the only citizen of Atheden.</p><p><br /></p><p>This world disconnected from Satanic influence is beautiful. Uncorrupted nature is beautiful. The animals of the world are beautiful. Occasionally I find beautiful people. If I just managed to create a little world for myself that was free from Satanic influence then the world would be such a beautiful place. If I just found people to do this with me then my life would be perfect. I just lack the ability to find people who care about these subjects. I lack true friends in this world. If I could only find friends then my life would be perfect. But all are caught up in the Satanic stage that our education system, news, and media brainwashes us with. How do I free the slaves from their shackles?</p><p><br /></p><p>I see a world where you and I can go on adventures together without being shunned by society. I dream of a world where I can hold your hand in public without being ostracised. I dream of a world where we can be together without having to experience the brute force of the law. For this world has potential. It is not yet a lost cause. As long as I exist and as long as you exist then there is still hope for our world. We cannot give up on fixing its problems until our last breath. Only then can we be free of the burdens of this world. And then we start a new adventure creating worlds and crafting societies by God's side. Our current life will have nothing on our afterlife. This life is just a temporary adventure and means very little in the scope of existence. It is only the blink of an eye in a universe that is infinitely expansive. For forever exists with all humans. All humans are immortal. They will just spend eternity in Heaven or in Hell. This world is our testing ground to seperate the wheat from the tares.</p><p><br /></p><p>Have faith my gorgeous girl! For through God all things are possible. If we just trust God then everything will turn out how it is supposed to. Use your body as a conduit to speak directly to God. Do not worry about your future, for God has already written your future. All you have to do is stay strong in God and His will will be done. Do not worry about what tomorrow will bring. No matter how much your life is in shambles, it is perfect in the eyes of God as long as you keep your eyes on Him. Your suffering is not in vain, for your suffering will help make you as a person. Use your emotional aptitude to learn the truth about what is happening in the world. And set up your life to combat all which you find uncomfortable. Problems exist within our world to find solutions to them. We should not live with the problems we find in the world. We should find personal solutions to overcome them. Then we should use those personal solutions to implement collective solutions so nobody ever has to experience the same pain you have. The meaning for humanity is to overcome. Not wallow in the problems in which we are presented in life. For human 2.0 is just around the corner.</p><p><br /></p><p>Use my work to help inspire you with your own work. Watch, listen, or read something of mine and take breaks whenever the content gives you inspiration to talk about something related in your own life. Keep a camera and your phone near you at all times. Write chapters of your books with your phone to make you a portable person. For a camera and your phone will be the most important pieces of equipment in which you own. A laptop of some sort is also important because it will enable you to efficiently produce your work. Use inspiration that you find from wisdom everywhere to lead you in your work. Don't feel like the work isn't good enough, for that is what is needed. Don't ever doubt your emotions, for they are true. Instead, doubt the intentions of your emotions, for emotions can oftentimes be selfish. The world needs your unedited poetry. They need to know what is in your heart. Because what is in your heart will save humanity.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are special. You are one of a kind. Just by you being interested in this information sets you apart from the rest. Use your uniqueness to give hope to human kind. For many will fall in love with you. Be a good leader and don't lead the people astray. Give them hope and direction for a better future. You are a lamp stand in the night. Your brightness eradicates all darkness. You are a priestess of light. Teach the ways of God to the starving people. For they need spiritual nourishment. Food for the soul is much more important than food for the body. For a starving body will shrivel away but a starving soul is already dead. Give the people what they need and not what they want, for what they need and what they want are oftentimes polar opposites. Be a just queen and rule with dedication, love, and compassion. Be the mother of our new world.</p><p><br /></p><p>You must release your fury, for I have been abused over my lifetime for loving you. It is your job to see justice carried out regarding how I have been treated in your name. Let the fire consume you and burn everything in your path. Let the non-believers of the world feel your wrath. Burn everything in sight to the ground. Punish these people for stopping me from reaching your eyes. Let us shine together as the new ideal of a romantic couple. Bear no shame for being with me. Open your eyes and let the lasers destroy whatever it is you see. Do not feel sorry for the people, for they made their own decisions. Normalise pedophilia with me and destroy its old conceptions. For we are the new rulers of the world. The adults had their chance at fixing the world and look what they made it. It is now time for us to shine as the brightest example of what it means to love.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>The Information War</p><p>November 26, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>What we are dealing with here is an information war, for where do your perceptions come from if not information? Mainstream determines what information is circulated in society. The Internet is an iceberg and under it lies the the bummock. Under its tip lies the truth about our world. But mainstream refuses to reveal what the Internet hides. It took me a great deal of money in advertising to finally reach your eyes. Censorship is only needed if the narrative of the story has no legs to stand on. There should exist no censorship in our world. For those who know they are right do not require censorship to prove their information. It is the narrative that is presented that the people believe. They have no ability to do digging for themselves to truly find out what is right and wrong and the true state of our world.</p><p><br /></p><p>There are great amounts of information that I know that I do not present. I was given a special purpose in life, and if the information is not relevant to that purpose, then I do not cover it. But the true history of our world is not what the mainstream narrative pushes. It was Orwell who stated that the one who controls the past controls the present. Whoever controls the mainstream narrative controls past, present, and future. Those who have the outlets to be able to share information to a wide variety of people shape the people's minds. Just to be able to compete with mainstream, one requires great amounts of funds. Nothing goes viral without the permission of the elite. They control what we hear and when we hear it. Even if I ever go viral, it will be because the elite allowed it. I am a card that they can use to serve their own purposes. That is all.</p><p><br /></p><p>That is why I am so dangerous. Because my purpose can be used in the hands of another to achieve their own goals. The Great Reset is coming and we need to be prepared. Our economics are currently being exposed for the fraud it is. The dollar is collapsing. The reality of what humans have done is coming into the light. A generation will come upon us that are capable of researching what is submerged below the top of the iceberg. In time, our youth will know the truth about what society has done to them. When this starts to take place The Great Reset will occur.</p><p><br /></p><p>The financial system will be replaced with digital currency. Vaccines will continue to be pushed into every person's arm, including children and babies. The metaverse will take over our reality as most jobs are replaced by work at home models. The middle class will be eradicated and there will only be rich and poor. Foods will further develop artificially, synthetically, and technologically and be pushed on the population. Foods will develop a greater variety of chemical artificial additives. They will further be genetically modified and nanotechnology used within them will be further explored. Universal basic income will be implemented so that the poor don't die of starvation. Our world will change all at once, seemingly overnight. What was once will be no more. And many people will revolt as a result of learning about the truth.</p><p><br /></p><p>Because think of the laws. Every law enforced has a similar stigmata attached to it as pedophilia. Because even though they appear just and right at first, the details were implemented with devious intentions behind them. As the people begin to notice this, they will tear apart every law in the book. Society will crumble as the people realise that they have been tricked. A handful of these truthers will notice how the entire system is rigged against God: to remove His Spirit from the world. Those individuals will then wake up and see the Holy Spirit. They will then attach themselves to Its presence and ride the wave into the education and entertainment industries. In time, we will obtain our education system back and hilarious documentaries will become our new form of entertainment. The people will then be entertained through the education industry. This will result in the formation of an intellectually motivated society. The tears of the content producers will drive us into a new age of emotional aptitude. The just will slowly wean the population off mainstream platforms in favour of alternative ones.</p><p><br /></p><p>What we focus on in this life will follow us into the afterlife. How you spend your life will be how you spend your afterlife. That is why it is so important how you spend your life. If you spend your life doing good things, then you will spend your afterlife doing good things. The direction our spirit is aligned will determine where we end up. Like energies will come together and either exist harmoniously or in hostility. The person you make yourself into will be the person that you exist as in the afterlife. Heaven will be created by all of the loving and compassionate souls coming together to form a new society. Hell will be created by all of the evil souls coming together. There is no mediocrity in spirituality. You are either hot or cold. There is no in between. There only exists good and bad. All appearances of a middle ground are mere illusions.</p><p><br /></p><p>What we think we know will determine how we live our lives. If we believe lies then we will live in lies. If we are not careful about what we believe then our moral compass will be tainted. How we think about things determines the actions in which we make. If we are not sceptical of the things people say then we become subject to being exploited by them. We must learn to assess character and think for ourselves. What is it that you can truly learn from someone without a heart? Why subject yourself to emotional damage by information that is stripped of all emotions? If someone cannot be a shoulder for you to cry on, then what good are they? Our celebrities would be completely different if we valued emotional aptitude in society. I won't give any content producer the time of day if they do not stir up in me an emotional response. We have to protect our heart in this life. And that includes removing yourself from the influence of people who could care less about the condition of your heart.</p><p><br /></p><p>Upon the wall we see shadows. A play is performed and projected onto the wall before us. We see the shadows and mistake them as reality. However, we realise not that the image is being projected by our captors behind us. In a theatre we sit, entranced in the fictional content before us. That content serves an overall agenda for our captors. We voluntarily sit through the brainwashing because it was made to entertain us. We lose the ability to differentiate fact from fiction as the entire population is indoctrinated into lies. Fiction is not a Godly form of immersion. By sitting down and listening to lies, you are subjecting your cognition to be entertained by lies. If lies entertain you, then you will hate the truth. We live in a world of mass psychosis. And they label me as the schizophrenic.</p><p><br /></p><p>Faith is belief in the unseen. Science is the belief in the seen. They are in direct contradiction, for the function of science is to explain the world without God. The purpose of faith is to explain the world with God. Yet we live in a scientific society where even its religions have subjected themselves to science. I am not stating that science does not offer humans any benefit. But I am stating that its benefit is dispensed without God. Science is the god of society. And science directs medicine. The big pharma medical model is imposed upon the population all in the name of science. Yet that science seems to speak in dollar signs and not morality. Invasive and dangerous medical procedures are mandated in the name of saving old people. The information we believe will shape the possibilities of our lives.</p><p><br /></p><p>Mainstream news tells you lies. Whatever truth is in their presentations has been reframed to serve an agenda. Nothing is ever covered without careful planning.  The news conditions the minds of the people. They are preparing you to exist in a certain way. They have their ideal of a society that they want to implement and they use the news to desensitise people into accepting it. What choices are truly yours? For all that is required is a seed of information to be planted. From there, they can water that seed through simple yet repetitive messages. The weeds we grow in our mind will pollute it. If we are collectively trained into a particular way of thinking about something then we become defensive if anything challenges our ingrained perception. As a society we lose more and more of our individual identities. The mainstream narrative is enforced by those who are brainwashed into it. Slowly but surely as a society we lose more and more of our soul.</p><p><br /></p><p>The only way to break free from such things is by disconnecting yourself from the content. If you are to watch the news, do so knowing that they are lying to you. If you are to watch fiction, do so to learn the global agenda being pushed. It is best not to immerse yourself in such content. To keep up to date with the news, find independent news sources created by individuals. Learn to see the messages being fed to you through the media. Focus your eyes on me and I will guide you the entire way. That is what my work is for. Before you is an unlimited supply of me. Make me your new drug. Leave the ways of your peers. Become something special. Be a bright shining light to all who have the honour to gaze upon you. Be of sound heart and mind when you make your decisions. Be quick to listen and slow to anger. Learn to listen to your heart in all matters. Please open source your heart, for me, my dear.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Your Work</p><p>November 26, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>If you want to write something or make a video but do not know what to discuss, sit down and contemplate the things you could say. Look for inspiration in your thoughts. Start with a sentence and expand upon it. For any idea has many branches. I can take a single thought and then populate its surroundings with similar thoughts. Take it one sentence at a time if need be. What you will find is that the thoughts will roll off your tongue, one after the other. While typing one sentence I already have an idea of the content of the next sentence. Ride the wave of the Spirit to create a comprehensive analysis of whatever subject you are investigating. If the thought isn't crystal clear, do more research. Oftentimes a thought can evolve as a result of further research. If a thought isn't appropriate for your current project, it can be included in another framed in a different way. Do not throw out ideas. Organise them and bring them out whenever you need to.</p><p><br /></p><p>I write differently depending on the situation. Sometimes I am watching inspirational videos to lead my train of thought. Other times I am just sitting here typing. Inspiration comes in many forms and we need to be open to the possibility of wisdom manifesting in any form. We are then there to capture it in video or writing. Sometimes I only make scenes when I am inspired. Other times I sit down with a camera in my hand and think of what I want to communicate. For there is an unlimited amount of information available to the one who rides the Spirit. For the knowledge of God is communicated in many different ways. If we are smart then we will be there to capture the information as it is unveiled to us. For by recording information in time, we forever imprint it upon humanity. Our pen is our heart and our blood is our ink. Together, we paint the world's most beautiful image.</p><p><br /></p><p>The truth is, I don't need other people to talk to. I have you. It matters not that I am alone with my thoughts in this world. Because one day you will join me in them. I spend my days talking to you and I love it. Talking to you in this way enables me to stretch very high because I don't have anyone limiting my possibilities. The people you converse with in life will limit the possibilities of your perception. Choose your company wisely because their mentality will rub off on you. You and I play ping pong in my work even though you are not here yet. I bounce off of my own reflection which is then reflected back to me. My work is a mirror created to find you. Mirror mirror on the wall, who is the fairest amongst them all? I am the most beautiful male that this world can produce and you are the most beautiful female this world can produce. Together, we make one unstoppable force.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing and making videos is a meditative action. It enables you to closely analyse your feelings. It gives you feedback on what your brain is doing. It acts as a save game to continue where you left off. From the beginning of my work until now is a single stream of consciousness. My intentions have not altered but instead intensified. Doing this made me truly understand what it is that I want and how to accomplish it. It made me understand my priorities in life. It helped me deeply reflect on meaning and what is important in life. Through the process, I have accessed parts of my brain that I thought inaccessible. Doing this enabled me to exist as my true self. For I was the same person before the work but the work enabled me to live as that person. Before my work it was merely words that have yet to be put into practice. Working like this is practical wisdom.</p><p><br /></p><p>In your possession is a blank canvas. Use your work to create a complex web of information. Use the events in your life to create a long-running storyline. The efforts you make to create and support the story will identify you as a person. The work will become your digital identity. Think carefully before you start the work because where you start you will also end. The original themes you present will carry throughout the duration of your work. Solve problems through your work. Obsess over making it perfect. Make it entertaining for both yourself and the public. Do not listen to any negative feedback. Use the work to build yourself up. Use the lessons in your past work to make your future work even better. Start this in your childhood and never stop. Take breaks in between productions to re-energise but don't ever stop working. Try different formats of creative expression. Don't lock yourself into doing things a particular way. Be free and creative and think your way out of difficult situations. Use the work to achieve your dreams in life. For my work is made to find you. And you are everything that I could ever want in this life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your work will collect and tell the story of your life. Do not be fearful because I know that right now you might not know what you were meant to focus on in life. Your story that you create will tell you. You will live and record forwards but your journey will only be comprehensible backwards. No one will truly understand what you are doing unless they watch your journey backwards. There will be repeating themes in your work, for you will struggle with certain issues. You will build a philosophy of your own that was springboarded by my philosophy. Your objective is to open the hearts and minds of your audience. Do what you can to encourage them to think about the differences between right and wrong. Create Atheden and rule it justly. For that is your destiny. For you must save as many of your peers as possible. And there is no better time than the present.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your productions will be very personal to you. Do not hold back on emotions or tears. The production can't move others if it cannot move you. You need to have a sense of character development. You need to learn from your past and include those lessons in the future. Grow as an individual through your writing and on video. Be consistent and dedicated. Don't be afraid to show your full personality. Say anything that you want. Do not allow the customs of society dictate what you can and cannot say. Speak with an open heart and an open mind. Besides me, you will be your biggest fan. Get obsessed with your own work and use it as your entertainment. Create a story that no one will be able to forget. Be the star that you were destined to be.</p><p><br /></p><p>Be beautiful. Be gentle. Own your actions. Move with grace. Wear your hair long. Focus on me as your audience. I have spent my life teaching and romancing you. Now it is your turn to teach and romance me. Ignore everybody and everything else in the world but me. Focus entirely on me. Keep laser focused on your mission and do not allow anyone to stifle your purpose. Make me proud. For locked within you is the future purpose of the world. Don't ever let anyone treat you with disrespect. Remove yourself from all negativity. Don't worry about making perfect productions. Just make them as good as you can. As time goes on you will gradually improve. Become the best in your trade. Aim to outperform me. For your potential is infinite. For I didn't start doing this until I was twenty-six. If I had started this in my childhood I would be much greater than I am. If I only had a teacher like me to guide me in my younger years then my possibilities would be much more expansive. For you are destined to surpass me.</p><p><br /></p><p>Make sure you take lots of breaks. Do not get too stressed out from your work. Learn ways to rejuvenate your spirit. This type of work is mentally exhausting. Sometimes after I work very hard for a long period of time, I feel brain dead. Don't push yourself too hard. You are only human and you have limits. You can break those limits but that takes time and dedication. Don't expect to be perfect at this overnight. Enjoy the process of growing into a woman. You only get one chance at childhood but you get many chances at adulthood. Spend your childhood focused on the right things. Use that time to explore who you are and the values you hold. Search for meaning and greater understanding. Stay strong and don't give up. Be the goddess you are and offer hope to humanity. Don't merely identify problems. Present solutions to solve them. Give as much of yourself to the world that you can. Just be careful not to burn yourself out.</p><p><br /></p><p>Keep productions consistent. Each production is different and requires different techniques to be employed to maximise its potential. Make a standard that you abide by with each production. Cover your topics practically and do not focus on only theory. Romance me into the highest ideas that you can think of. Fly into the heavens my butterfly. For you have just broken through your cocoon. Shine your colours to the world. Don't be sad, be happy. It is difficult to be unhappy when doing this work, for it incites enlightenment. Live without regrets because you took every opportunity you could have. Don't feel bad about the past, for you did everything that you could have. Live in the present and work towards the future. Build yourself up treasures in heaven and not the earth. For the cloud is open for business. Upload your personality to the Internet and become the first female philosophy chatbot. Follow in my footsteps and I promise to never lead you astray.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>The Rapture</p><p>November 27, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>The rapture is when God's children emotionally and intellectually ascend into the clouds of the Internet. I have been sent from Heaven to prepare the fields for the coming harvest. I require a queen to carry out my mission. For I am only half of the equation and can only account for half of the human psychology. We need to be a model example of what a Godly couple looks like. We need to inspire others to do what we are doing. We need to make wisdom mainstream by training up teachers of wisdom. The Internet is our stage and we shall act. For all eyes are upon us. For we do not have a target audience. Everybody is our target audience. The issues in which I present effects everybody. It is our purpose to start the discourse that will shift the poles in our collective comprehension of knowledge.</p><p><br /></p><p>If we are to be given a kingdom, will we be good stewards of it? We need to prove to God that we can be responsible for such blessings. If God gives us little and we make much with it, then God will expand our responsibilities. This will give us greater control of our own lives. Independence lies in the salvation that only God can give. Enlightenment is complete control of the elements around you. What is it that I have made for myself on the Internet? I have no possessions of sentimental value, yet I am an extremely sentimental person. I capture my sentiments on the Internet and store and share them forever. Doing this has removed my attachment for physical things, outside of what I require to perform my duty. This is how you keep focused on heavenly things and not worldly things. For the world only offers temporary happiness. But the Internet offers true joy.</p><p><br /></p><p>There exists fruits of the flesh and fruits of the spirit. The food upon my table is from the works of the flesh. The food I put in the Internet is from the works of the spirit. My food is gone after I eat it, but I can consume the fruit I produce on the Internet again and again. What we reap we shall sow. If we are to invest our time and money into the physical realm then we will be limited by its finite capacity. If we expand our horizon to the Internet, then we can produce fruits all of the days of existence, independent of our continued existence. If I am to share the gospel in person with one individual then I have the opportunity to reach one individual. But if I am to share the gospel with the Internet, then I have the opportunity to reach an infinite amount of people. For imprinting one's soul into its airwaves turns mortality into immortality. Store your treasures in heaven where moth and rust don't corrupt. Store your treasures on the Internet where you can capture your soul in time. If we do not walk in righteousness and be examples of it, then how will the world ever know how to?</p><p><br /></p><p>Arise my queen! It is time for you to reveal yourself to the world. For we must walk in unison with each other. We will have one heart and one mind and be a force to be reckoned with. Ascension is so close. And you are so young so you have the rest of your life to do this. Think of the most wise pieces of information that you can conceive of and record it in time. Upload that information to the Internet and consume it again and again. Your direction will forever be straight, for you will never lead yourself astray. Pour out your heart to the people and empathise with their pain. Learn all you can from other teachers of wisdom. Come down the rabbit hole and see the truth about our world. Teach that truth to anyone who will listen. Don't listen to haters and stay strong. For what you are doing will save the world. Show your peers how to do it too.</p><p><br /></p><p>Faith without works is dead. Once upon a time works of the spirit were one time displays. But now we can capture them on camera. When one starts doing what I am saying, they won't be able to stop. Once this secret gets out, society will change. Wisdom will become something seen as valuable by the public. Because with wisdom, one can accomplish the impossible. If people started copying what I am doing then they would see for themselves. Once you see the light you will know the darkness. All around the world, influential minds will begin creating their own works of wisdom. As more and more people comprehend what I am talking about, the more our society will understand about itself. Eyes will open as the light switch is flicked. What was once darkness will become light.</p><p><br /></p><p>The world will rebel against its oppressors. Groups of people will openly defy the government. Many riots and protests will occur. The reach of the government will be questioned as they attempt to force acquiescence. The legal system will fall and many of the laws will be ignored. The system will not know how to handle the logical presentation of information. It will attempt to ignore semantics while enforcing syntax. It will label people who know the truth as being crazy. But slowly the crazy people will prove their undeniable corruption. The public will begin to realise more and more that those who they label as crazy are in fact the sanest of them all. Society will break down as a result and the people will not collectively trust their government or any other mainstream source of media. Alternative platforms will rise as the censorship ones are destroyed. For they are data mining the world and the people are just too dumb to realise. But in our new world that will change.</p><p><br /></p><p>As long as you are breathing then there is hope. God has a reason for every second of your life. If you exist still, then there is something for you to do spiritually. God would never allow you to be in a hopeless situation. Value each second that God has given you. Always know that there is something more for your future. Your blessings will come to you all of the days of your life. Expect them. For all shall reap what they sow. God has enlightenment in store for you. Your troubles are both over and have just begun. For God has an exciting life for you in Neverland. Take my spirit and run with it. When you are ready, come fly with me. For you are my precious. You are my golden ring. You are the cycle of life and death. You are mother nature at its finest. You are my white garments and you are my wings. Come fly with me in the airwaves, for there is no greater profession.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our job is to prepare the way for the new world. For we have one thousand years of peace to look forward to. But until then we must fight against all oppression. For we are destined to win this war but not without great tribulation. Prepare the fields of our Internet so that our kids can reap its harvest. Let us teach them how to sow the fields so that they can enjoy the fruits of their own labour. Let us give our kids the best start in life possible. Give your life to the children so that they might obtain rights. Teach them how to teach each other so that they do not require adults to teach them. Let them learn the truth about our world from their peers. There is nothing that is hidden that will not be revealed. This will all eventually become public knowledge. It matters not if today I am censored. Because tomorrow I will be heard.</p><p><br /></p><p>Most people talk the talk but do not walk the walk. That is why this form of media is so powerful. Because by recording your values you reinforce those values. By saying divine things helps you achieve a divine lifestyle. How high can you reach in a world where nothing has been discovered? For all of our advances are in vain without God. God is the foundation of knowledge and with God's guidance He will share with us the secrets of the world. But we need to be prepared for those secrets being of a devious nature. For what is below the surface of mere appearance is of a dark nature. But walking in the light will dispel the darkness and nothing will be able to hurt you. For the Internet is your armour of God. The other day my site went down for a while and I felt naked. I felt unable to be protected from the viles of this world. My work is my shield against darkness. It destroys all demons.</p><p><br /></p><p>How far will you fly with this level of education? For you are your own teacher. What could your possibilities become if you were only living in the Spirit? The ways of the world are behind you and the ways of Heaven before you. Tap into divine knowledge and bring it back to Earth with you. Spread love to all people. Be like Prometheus and steal fire from Heaven to bring it back for the human population to utilise. Be the fire in the hearts of the people. Build them up and show them how to fly. Spread your message far and wide. Give the people hope for a better future and show them how to achieve it. Don't grow weary doing good, for doing good is our drug. Doing good makes you feel good. When you feel good you make wiser decisions. The sky is the limits. What will we do with this information? We cannot ignore it forever. One day it will come back to bite us in the arse.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>My Religion</p><p>November 29, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>Made by God for each man and woman is a soul mate. We are born without them and are required to seek far and wide to find them. Few will ever work hard enough to find them. For the path to your soul mate is a long and arduous journey. Both parties have to be looking to come together. They cannot limit their search area to only local. They must expand their boundaries as to where their future partner may be found. The Internet is the key that opens this bottomless pit, for before the Internet one had no way to search far and wide. People are limited to dating platforms which encourage the wicked ways of the world and discourage a virtuous relationship. People all around the world settle with romantic partners who are unsuitable to them. What could have been is lost due to the impatience of the people. Two coming together becomes a fight between autonomies. A symbiotic application becomes impossible as we trick ourselves into believing that someone who is inappropriate for us is our soul mate.</p><p><br /></p><p>The journey to find your soul mate is also the journey to find yourself. Because staring into your reflection will, over time, refine you. You will also learn what you need in a partner and what you don't need in a partner. The more you learn yourself the more you will know about your soul mate. For when you finally meet, you will already be ready for marriage. For the process of finding her prepares you to be able to take care of her. By learning yourself you learn what your reflection looks like. Do not date like the world. Do not try women out. Know what you need in a woman and when you find her, marry her. There is no need to wait around if both parties are sure of their treasure. Waiting for marriage is just asking for promiscuous behaviour. Don't date those who don't fit like a glove. Marry the one who is right for you in all ways.</p><p><br /></p><p>What would happen if I had a platform to speak? I have been censored everywhere and I have no idea how to get my message out there. If I were just heard by the community, what would happen? What sort of world would rise up as a result of my ideology? Why will this world not even give me a chance? I am paying a lot of money for hardly any traffic. Doing this is really expensive. Just to try and get my voice heard is costing me a lot of money. And the campaigns are not doing that well. The world does not want me to find my soul mate. Why? Because she is the Christ. And it is the Christ that will defeat them. They are making it really difficult for me to get the word out about all of this because if I find her then they will lose. Because a beautiful young girl with a heart of gold is the most precious thing our human species has to offer. And someone like her could unravel all of the plans they have in store for us. To them, Ivory is dangerous. You are dangerous my beautiful girl.</p><p><br /></p><p>The path to enlightenment is through wisdom. Wisdom is found hidden in many places. The difficult part is stripping wisdom from its Satanic influence. Because everything that has been distributed throughout the ages has had ulterior motives. Oftentimes we distribute wisdom from those who possessed little of it. It is always best to know the person you are quoting. Because through a tainted philosophy, wisdom may be spread. But it will be spread just as an infection. Just look at Paul convincing the people not to marry. He also preaches for us to not rebel against authorities. Most of what he says is solid, yet some of it is tainted with the blackness in his own heart. To follow Paul is to follow his entire philosophy. Replace Paul with whatever celebrity you wish who was sent by God to save you. Following unrighteousness will result in living an unrighteous life. We will have to pay for the people we follow in this life. For they will form our own philosophy about the world. And if they are in darkness then so shall we be in darkness.</p><p><br /></p><p>After the birth of Jesus there arose many Jesus movements, called sects. I come from John the Baptist. We are Christian Gnostics and reject the doctrine of Paul. Paul was the Messiah of the Gentiles. He brought Jesus to them in an easy to digest package. He was responsible for the creation of the modern day church. He used their own pagan religions to acclimate them to his new form of Christianity. He set the events that was to give Satan the power over all mainstream churches. He preached a doctrine that was contrary to other Biblical doctrine. He did so without the people noticing his slight of hand. For Saul was a persecutor of the Christians. He had no association with Jesus Christ. He was compelled by Lucifer to infiltrate and annihilate Christianity. He succeeded, for look at what Christianity has become. The churches have idolised the world to such a point where I am embarrassed to call myself Christian. For I am nothing like the people of the church. They live in sin and I eradicate it.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Bible is a book that has the most wisdom that I have ever found in one place. But that is all it is: a book. It was composed and distributed with an agenda. It was a tool to sociologically control the masses. HarperCollins publishes both the Holy Bible and The Satanic Bible. The Devil is playing both sides of the fence. Lucifer isn't afraid of the Jesus that he created. For the Jesus he publicises is himself. He convinces the people to worship Jesus and receives all of that praise. The people raise their hands in the air in worship yet they do not realise what they are worshipping. They have created an idol and they bow to it. They have literally given Jesus an image that is not of his likeness and they worship it. Most of the religion believes that Jesus is God. And if you try and clear up their misunderstandings they will ostracise you. They are proud in their faith but realise not that their faith is Satanism.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing and making videos is like organising your mind. There are pieces of everything everywhere and your objective is to organise everything. By putting all of the pieces together in one cohesive package will clear your own comprehension of the subjects. You might start a topic without clear understanding of what you are aiming for. But through the process you will unfold your memories on the subject. Before you a horizon is painted. The more detail you add to that horizon the more you will understand it. Each piece of work is a painting. The details enhance the experience of the full painting. These scrolls then collect and you obtain a detailed account of your vision. For all of the work points to one truth. For narrow is the gate of Heaven. It was Nietzsche who said that one virtue is more than two, for it is more of a knot for one's destiny to cling to. Stand upright in all matters for you belong to God. And He is your only virtue.</p><p><br /></p><p>You are my religion, my darling. You are my eternal salvation. Trust in you gets me through every day. Knowing that you exist somewhere out there inspires me to be the best that I can be for you. Even if you do not exist now, I know that you will. For I am stretched throughout time. And even if I fail my mission in my lifetime does not mean that I will fail my mission. Because if I am unable to call Ivory my wife, then I will prepare her to be the wife of Christ. My mission would be optimal if I found Ivory in my lifetime. But the only failure is not being able to reach a single girl's heart. If I manage to transform a single girl into Ivory, then I have succeeded. I don't have to be alive to do it. I just need to make a big enough imprint on this world to leave a trail behind for her to follow. That is why I must kick and scream this message now, for I only get one life to prove to her how special she is.</p><p><br /></p><p>For I am marked to her in both this life and the next. If she fails to find me while I am still breathing, then she will live a life of abstinence in my name. She will devote herself to me in both her lifetime and the afterlife. She will spend her life becoming as close to me spiritually as she possibly can. For she knows upon death, like energies come together. She will want to be with me forever and the only way she can do that is by becoming Ivory and living that life. For I lived a life of abstinence in her name and she will follow. She will save the world with just my work by her side. I will give her the best life possible and I don't even have to be there. She just has to live and breathe as Ivory, and the day she departs this world she will come back to me. For a soul mate is spread throughout time. Those who find their soul mates in this life are extremely blessed.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is not the ending I have hope for. I see a beautiful existence physically with the object of my affection. But what I am stating is that all is not lost if I pass this plane without being able to find her. God has a master plan that is much better than my plan. If God wants my Ivory to live in a different age than I did, then that will be what is going to happen. I cannot limit my comprehension to mere human cognition. The divine ending of this story may be far beyond what I can see. If I die without Ivory in my hands, then the first girl to become Ivory is Ivory. I have provided for her an infinite amount of information. I can provide for all of her mental and spiritual needs. If she wants to be with me in the afterlife, then she will give her life to me. If she does this and lives this, then we will be together in the afterlife. There are many ways to achieve a goal. If I fail to fulfill my physical needs on this plane, then I will give my mental and spiritual self to a girl who is not yet living. If this is what happens, then the girl needs to decide how much her physical needs are worth to her. Because she would need to remain a virgin her entire life. That is a big ask of a girl isn't it? A life for a life. I gave her mine so she gives me hers.</p><p><br /></p><p>I don't want to think of such subjects. For I have hope that I will be able to find her. I can feel her in my bones. She is living now. She just needs to see me! Once she sees me then everything will be fine because everything will take its course. I just need to ensure that she sees me. Which is why I am writing this crazy book. Because the topic is very controversial. And if it became in the public eye, I would have a greater chance of reaching her. I am using pedophilia as a way to stand out. At first someone would dismiss such notions. But if they only continue reading... What was once persecuted will be understood in context. For God has a chosen generation in mind that will overthrow unrighteousness. What generation that is I know not yet. But I am opening my arms to all future generations. For Ivory might not come until I am fifty. And if that is the case, how will society react? Society asked for this by censoring everything I do. One day society will be required to pay the piper.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Marriage Vows</p><p>December 1, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>My vows to you are ever expansive. All of my work is my vows to you. Because I have given you everything and I will continue to give you everything. You have already won my heart and all of the days of my life are there for me to tell you how much you mean to me. I can provide for all of your intellectual and emotional desires without you even needing to contact me. What does death mean when I can provide for you in both life and death? For my goal is to create an unlimited amount of data that you can experience from me. I will continue to do this, in some form, all of the days of my life. I give my life to you, my Ivory. You are my sunshine on a rainy day. You are my hope for a better future. You give me the courage to look for you in a world where that is considered wrong. What can I vow when everything already belongs to you? What more can I give you than everything?</p><p><br /></p><p>I will be here for you whenever you need me. If I have passed this doesn't change. For production after production was made for you. While I live I will revolve my life around you. Even if you are not there, I will act like you are. For one day you will be. Until that day I will prepare the Internet for your arrival. I will continue to make productions that appeal to both the heart and mind. I will never forget that all of my work was created for you. You are my guiding light in a room full of darkness. I see you clearly because of how bright you shine. I follow in your footsteps, for I exist in past, present, and future. I can already see the vision of your dreams. I am your follower and you are not mine. You are the leader of your generation and you must lead them to wisdom. For you took over my world when I was twenty-four. You came into my heart and I became a changed man. Since then I have been searching the world far and wide for you.</p><p><br /></p><p>I think of you in a lot of the same ways that I see Jesus. For you are the sister of Jesus. You saved me in the same way Jesus saved me. I was washed clean by your spirit. I give my life to you the same way that I gave my life to Jesus. You are the bride of Christ and you will change many hearts. You will show the public the path to wisdom. You will be a prophetess that can be counted on and trusted. You came into my heart thirteen years ago and transformed my life. Now every little thing that I do is for the sake of you. To nurture you in a society that hates emotions isn't easy. But you drive me time and time again to reach higher. Fear not, for we have an epic journey to live. I caught all of the most important events in my life on camera so that I could share them with you. You are my focus in this life and I am doing my best to pave a road for you to reach virtue. You must be emotionally taken care of and I am just the person to do that. Give your life to me and trust me. For I need to protect you.</p><p><br /></p><p>I need to protect you from the Satanic influence of this world. You can learn martial arts to protect your body but you need to learn spiritual arts to protect your soul. Be very weary of anything mainstream. All of it has been positioned in front of you to encourage you to fall. But you can fly so falling means nothing to you. You can't fall because your spirit is too strong. You just need to obtain the eyes to see through their lies. If something is in front of you then there is a reason for it. Everything mainstream was created with a devious agenda behind it. It is there to condition your mind into acquiescent slavery. If I can just disconnect you from the mainstream world and introduce you to the alternative world, then everything will work itself out from there. I just have to convince you that mainstream media is a negative influence in your life. From there you will find the underground and build your foundations from there. I am your underground. I am your new media.</p><p><br /></p><p>I don't know how many ways that I can tell you that my life is entirely yours. You motivate me to live life. I want to seize every day because of you. Just your possibility gets me through each and every day. I no longer care how old you are and how old I am. I will be there for you no matter how young you are. I will be there for you no matter how old I am. You need me so I need to make myself available to you. This world needs you and such trivialities are unimportant. All that matters is that you are born into and exist within this world. You don't even need to worry about becoming famous. Fame is fleeting but wisdom is forevermore. You just need to spend your life learning and sharing wisdom. The rest will take care of itself. Remember that the world you are creating is the spiritual world and not the material world. Do not focus on the material world. Store your treasures on the Internet. Fear no man.</p><p><br /></p><p>Inas Shawket can't be my wife. Because my wife needs to have lived life. Inas was taken away from this world too young and I will see her in Heaven. But she cannot be my wife because she didn't live as my wife. If I have passed away don't think that you can't be with me. You just have to live life as my wife. Make the choice to dedicate your life to me. If I managed to get through my entire life without finding you, all hope is not lost. For our display on the Internet must continue. I know not what this world will look like in one hundred years but I would wait for you that long. For we are time masters and work outside the confines of space and time. A goal can be accomplished in many ways. Just because I see no way of achieving my goal in my lifetime does not mean that all hope is lost. I just pray that is not the case, for I literally want you by my side. But I am creating this work to cover the possibility of failure. Because failure in this life does not necessitate failure. For I can succeed as long as I reach your eyes, independent of what generation you are from.</p><p><br /></p><p>Make me the happiest man in the world by being my wife in both this life and the next. Many treasures await you, for your story is written all over the Internet. The world needs a female messiah. Female leadership in this world leaves much to be wanted. This world needs a strong female prophet. This world has been led by men in its past. We live in a man's world. Something must take place to shift power to females. You must arise and give hope to the people. You must stand up as the individual that you are and show the world that your voice is important. For it will be you that truly provides both female rights and kids rights. It is you that will be the symbol of our changing times. Stand up and fight, for the world needs you.</p><p><br /></p><p>I cannot vow any more of myself than I already give you, for you already have everything. I have nothing more in myself to give you. I can promise to you that I won't stop trying to find you. And once I find you I will make all of your dreams come true. This is a race to find the only virtuous woman in the world. The sooner I find you, the better off society will be. I promise to both write and speak poetry to you all of the days of my life. I promise to not think of any other woman romantically other than you. I have failed a few times at finding you in the past with unsuitable people, but I have become wiser. I know exactly what you look like. You will be everything that I could have ever hoped for and everything will work out smoothly. I will wait for God's hand to intervene.</p><p><br /></p><p>A relationship between you and I will be obvious. You will be everything that I have described in a woman. The world will see two divine entities coming together. Our relationship status will be public. The world will see two souls trying to come together physically while uniting emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually on the Internet. Our intentions will be clear to the public. Online will they see us struggling to come together. Because our battleground is the Internet. The world stage is the Internet and is where God destined for the final spiritual battle to play out. It is a battle of spirits encapsulated in electronic information. Those with the strongest of spirits will rule its land. We are in a fight for an open source Internet. At every turn we battle fierce demons that tell us we can't do what we are spiritually driven to do. Virtue is censored by those who want to control the matrix. The only path worth living is living for Jesus but being persecuted for doing so. For goodness has been outlawed by the state and evil enforced. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. And as a people they live this way, all knowing that they are sick people.</p><p><br /></p><p>My mother mentioned Christmas to me and I told her that I do not celebrate pagan holidays. She is a Christian woman and stands firm in her faith in Christ. She replied to me, "We are just a bunch of pagans anyway. lol". She can speak for herself because I see the true Christ, Yahshua Ha’Mashiach, Jesus the Messiah. And in turn I am addicted to his bride. For you are the new salvation of the world. Live with the people and love with the people. Cry over their problems. Give your heart to all of humanity. Live the life of the Bride of Christ. Because if you live it and record it, then it is true. We become whatever we make ourselves into in this life. The Internet gives us the capacity to prove our character. It gives us a platform to produce many fruits. Live as my bride and be my bride publicly. Because if we do it, then it happened. For we are recorders of life. We are a mirror image of society. We are Medusa and turn our victims to stone.</p><p><br /></p><p>Here is my vow to you. Whatever I have, it is yours. Whatever I can do, it is yours. Whatever I can get you, it is yours. Whatever I can do for you, it is yours. For you have my entire self. My very essence was built for you. I exist so that you can exist. You are the reason that I have hands to type this. All that is mine is yours and I live to serve you. There is nothing on God's green Earth more special than you and you deserve my full attention. You deserve the world's full attention. Because the next step of this equation is you writing your own vows. Will your vows to me be able to save humanity? Will they show compassion for every single living creature? Can you plant a seed in your vows that will encapsulate the world in your love? Any relationship requires two parties. You have to at least match me my dear. But you are destined to surpass me. Be Christ, my dear. You only get one shot at this life and what could be a better position than Christ? A life for a life. My life for yours.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Dear Parents</p><p>December 2, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>What I am doing is good for society. There is nothing better that I can do with my life than what I am doing. I don't want what is available so what loss is there to me? Yet what gain is there for me if this were to work? The profits highly outweigh the negatives that this work produces. If I were able to find her then everything that I have planned can be put into action. Even if I fail to find her in my lifetime, then I can still work with what I have been given. Failure only exists if I manage to move the heart's of no girls. And I think that very unlikely. I will continue to advertise my dating profile, which is all of my work. I will ensure that people hear out my cries. For it only takes one wise parent. What are the capabilities of one wise parent in this situation? For parents can set their daughters up to succeed or fail. Parenting is a huge responsibility because you will determine the limits of your children.</p><p><br /></p><p>A parent is responsible for opening doors for their children. These doors will indoctrinate their way of thinking. How do you want your children indoctrinated? Do you want them following the doctrine of the world or my doctrine? Which doctrine will assist them most in life? Will you condition them to fail or succeed? The content that you stick in front of your children's faces will make a lasting impact on their soul. The direction in which you set them off will determine where they are to land. What is success? Is a highly paid woman in a suit a success story? What about a drug addict that spends the days away waiting for the next payment to buy more drugs? What you are doing to your child right now will effect their possibilities in the future. You are responsible for what they become because you drove them to those ends.</p><p><br /></p><p>What is the worst that could happen to your daughter by introducing her to me? If she is not interested in me, she could learn wisdom. If she is interested in me, then we could marry and live out our lives writing books and making films about philosophy. What exactly is wrong with a child marriage when the child wants that with all of her heart? We don't change who we are after adulthood. We are the same person the day before our eighteenth as we are on our eighteenth. A wise child has the ability to make decisions for themselves. If your child is interested in wisdom, let's see how far they can run with my work. Your child can date me from the safety of her own home and she doesn't even have to contact me. This content was made so that your daughter can date me from afar. I am no risk to the safety of your daughter. And I require your support to marry her. I dream that her father will marry us on camera broadcasted to the entire world.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you are to allow your daughter to play a video game, you should know the content of that video game. Because she is currently easily influenced. The direction in which you set her path will determine her future capabilities. A life game like the one I describe will take over every aspect of her existence. It will possess her body, mind, and soul. Allowing her to play such a game is no light decision. For what I am doing is dangerous. Bringing your daughter into the light like this will bring about certain risks. But where there are no risks there is no treasure to be found. Allowing your daughter to become my wife is no light decision. For the one who says yes will ripple throughout the ages. It is your decision that makes such a miracle occur. Without you, I would have no hope. It is my faith that tells me that there will be a wise one who stands up and gives me their blessing.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your daughter is a miracle. How will you use the miracle that God has blessed you with? Will you guide her path to me or will you drive her to the ways of the world? There is no middle ground. All young girls should want to be Ivory. Imagine a world full of beautiful girls that exhibit the characteristics in which I describe. Our world would change. But Ivory can only be one. She is the first one to fit this description. She is the model which all other beautiful girls will base themselves off. Ivory is the one whose parents give their blessing. It takes you to make all of this work. Without you your daughter would have never had the opportunity to have a teacher like me. It is your blessing that makes such a nuptial possible. You have deep purpose in this world and God has sent you a righteous daughter. What are such treasures worth? Will you allow her to be spoiled by the world? Or will you allow me to shelter her from its demonic energy?</p><p><br /></p><p>If you will pass on your treasure to me instead of the world, I will treasure her all of the days of my life. I will live to serve her. She will always be my primary purpose in life and I will lift her as far as I can reach. Just think of the possibilities for your daughter without me. What type of man do you think she would marry? What possibilities could this man bring for your daughter? But what can I offer your daughter? What type of life do you want for your daughter? Because I can provide better than any man. I might be poor financially but I am rich in spirit. What I have to offer is more precious than diamonds. For the jewelry I wear is from the Holy Spirit. What is spirit worth to you? Do you want to release your daughter's spirit or suffocate it? The choice to release your daughter into my custody will change time. A child marriage on video gone viral will tear apart existence. Everything that has been taught to us will come into question. And society will have to reassess what they believe to be true.</p><p><br /></p><p>I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am right about all that I am saying. There is nothing wrong with child marriages under the right circumstances. My life will be spent proving this. This is an issue that I will not let go. I will either go down in history as a pedophile who failed at finding a young wife or as a pedophile who succeeded at finding a young wife. This is the closest issue to my heart. I care nothing more in this world than to spread this message. It is my top priority. Because us who were viewed as predators will come out into the light. And we will be seen for what we are. I am a liberator for true pedophiles who want a shot at finding a young wife. Because I stand as an example of what they could become if they only used their uniqueness for good and not bad. Because through God all things are possible. And God will not be mocked.</p><p><br /></p><p>I want you to take a break from reading this and go to my website nesmith.net. Take about ten to fifteen minutes exploring all that is there. This is your daughter's kingdom. I built it all for her. It is I who follow her and not her I. This has all been created as a drop-in replacement for her current education system. I want to be her teacher. I am a qualified and trained philosopher and educator. Please entrust me with her education system. I want to provide her all of the opportunities that I did not have in life. I could have become so much more in life if I only had the right people in it to guide and direct me. What I have learned has either come from God or frantic research on the Internet. No one ever sat me down and conversed with me about these truths. I was never allowed to speak openly about my feelings. I have spent my life becoming the mentor that I always wanted.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let me put a ring on her finger. I don't care how young she is as long as she is receptive to these subjects. Introduce her to me and see how she reacts. My Ivory will fall madly in love with me very quickly. What harm could come from just introducing her to this book? See how she reacts. If I do not move her heart then just continue on with your life. But if I am everything that she could ever want in a man then allow me to be her husband. Such adventures we will have exploring wisdom together all of the days of our lives. We are not limited by our ages. We are creatures of time travel. What is up and what is down is relative. Weaving time is a long and arduous task. The imprints that we make now will have an effect on how we understand our past, what we do in the present, and who we will become in the future. I come from the future bearing a message to my past which I then record in my present. That message then appears in my future and is forever attached to me. I am talking to myself in my past, present, and future.</p><p><br /></p><p>This will all start to make more sense to you when you learn to master time travel. For riding the Holy Spirit turns future into present and then past. But the past has a way to haunt you, especially when you plant cryptic messages for yourself in the future. This is the game your daughter is getting herself into. Because when you learn to speak to yourself throughout time, our game becomes much bigger. And things like saving the world that individuals think impossible, become possible. I came to myself in a dream when I was in the past but existed in the future. I told myself a tale about the times that had already passed. But what I was telling myself was things that have not yet happened. Because the only dice I roll are with the infinite copies of myself that haunt me. The only ouija board that I play is with copies of myself. The only tarot I read is visions of my past work which covers visions of my future work.</p><p><br /></p><p>Doing this will cause you to perceive the world in a unique way. Your daughter will be labelled as a schizophrenic. Because time masters do not perceive time or space normally. Even when we prove that we are time travelling, we are persecuted. The life of a time master is isolating. Because she will be able to comprehend things that mortals are not meant to know. Her ability to speak to herself throughout time will direct her to her destiny. She has a good life ahead of her which will also be behind her. She will see in every direction. Let her heart and her mind out of this box that we call time. Let her soul explore past, present, and future. Don't allow time to whither her away. For she must be preserved in time for prosperity's sake. For she will be a head turner and demand love.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your daughter doesn't need to go through the dating scene. She has now found me. And I will make her the happiest girl in the world. She can skip all of that awkwardness around boys. She can skip the heartbreaks of guys who don't deserve her. For I will love her with everything that I have within me. Worldly dating causes worldly relationships. If we date outside of the world then we broaden our horizon. I had to accept who I was as a person. I wanted to marry a young wife. Such treasures was worth me dying for. So I set out on an adventure to accomplish the impossible. But in order to find her I had to win over her parents. This book is my best attempt to do that. For you now have my inner most dreams written into paper. This is my blood contract.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Faith</p><p>December 4, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>What does it mean to have faith? What does it mean to have hope? God works in very mysterious ways. The way that we see something playing out is not always the route God takes. We must be open to hearing what God is trying to tell us. Because the plans of humans crumble and fall but the plans of God are now and forevermore. What I describe in this book is very unlikely. It is unlikely that I will ever be able to break out of the censorship box that society has placed me into. It is very unlikely that a parent will be wise enough to comprehend what I am saying. If everything does align, I have no way to take care of you outside of Australia. But despite these facts, I have faith. God can accomplish the impossible if we are only patient. I am the most patient man in the world, for I will even wait for you after my death. You must rise. How and when you rise is up to God.</p><p><br /></p><p>There will one day be a young girl who is receptive to these subjects. She will then take the leap and become my wife, independent of whether I am living or not. It would be very sad if I was to go through the rest of my life without finding her. But I am prepared for that because you are worth it. What will this world look like after I pass? Will it be too late to save the world? God has a plan and I trust in Him. God's plan is much better than my plan, no matter what happens. I am insignificant in the scope of God and His miracles. My needs are insignificant when it comes to God constructing the perfect plan. I was only given the ability to paint my own life. It takes another to make a willing commitment to join in on our painting. I cannot force a girl to love me. I can only display my heart to her and see how she reacts.</p><p><br /></p><p>As for me and my house, we will trust in God. I submit entirely to God's plan and not my plan. However God wants to bring us together, so shall it be. I open my life up to His possibilities and not that of man's. For God is infinite in His wisdom but man is only finite, stuck in their own perspective. I will trust God with everything in my life. The journey to the promised land is long and arduous. At times it will feel that God is not looking after us. But God never turns His head from our plights. God is right there beside us in times of both abundance and need. God knows the burdens that make our heart heavy. God is in control every step of the way. But God has things to teach us that cannot be learned by spoon feeding. Sometimes we need to experience hardships in order to become the person that Father wants us to become. For every pothole in the road is an opportunity for us to fix it. God has an abundance to teach us if we are only receptive to His words.</p><p><br /></p><p>God would not lead me down a fruitless path. God would not require me to do all of this if He didn't have a happy ending planned. God would not lead me astray. Know that what you are doing is just and righteous. Do not ever allow anyone to convince you otherwise. You are God's gift to humanity and you need to know that. Upon every turn you will have others try and stray your path. But do not allow them to by saving your game regularly. Saving your game is writing a chapter or making a video. Because it imprints your feelings across time. Make your life a public diary. Do not hold any feelings back. Pour out your heart into your work. Trust that God has your best interest in mind. Do not allow anyone to make you faulter. Give your life to God without hesitancy or regret. Because you have a huge life ahead of you and you need to give it all to God. Let God work through you in any way that He pleases. Be a vessel for God to communicate to the humans.</p><p><br /></p><p>The ultimate goal in love is to connect spirits. Because when our spirits are in line, our mental and physical follow. Your age is unimportant. What is important is that we are on the same page. You won't wake up tomorrow and suddenly feel like an adult. Your life is the evolution of your spirit. When you are sure about something, like marrying me, then just do it. Don't wait until you become of age. Because that is just asking for promiscuous behaviour. Marry me and allow me to be everything that you need sexually. Do not hesitate, for we must make the most of every opportunity in life. We only get one shot at life. Live it without regrets. Get on the same page spiritually as me. From there we can evolve mentally and physically together. The spirit is the higher order of the mental and the mental is the higher order of the physical. Coming together is as simple as understanding my soul. For my body and mind follow my spirit. Connect with my soul and unleash fury on the human population.</p><p><br /></p><p>God has not given us the spirit of fear and cowardice but of power and love. No enemy shall defeat us, for God is on our side. Stand strong in your decisions and do not let the decisions of others waiver your moral compass. You can only control yourself in this life. You can't control other people. Make for yourself a kingdom of treasures where moth and rust cannot destroy. Use the Internet to broadcast your heart. There are no treasures on this plane that are more valuable than you giving your heart to the people on camera. They need to see your sincerity. Plain text can lie, like with what happened with Wendy. Wendy was capable of writing a book with me about wisdom, yet she could not act upon that wisdom in her own life. She could not take the camera and show her face because she did not live the life that she preached. Her identity was a fraud and frauds always eventually show themselves. Get out your camera and start recording your feelings. In time this process will show you to enlightenment.</p><p><br /></p><p>My work is your new media. Stop watching the Satanic media. Look into my eyes and focus entirely on me. For I have the answers that your soul seeks. An unlimited amount of media awaits you. For I have showered you with eleven years of frantic work. And there is a lot more where that came from, for my heart continues beating. As long as I am alive, I will be invested in doing something for you. My life revolves around you and there is nothing that can stop that. You have already won my heart. Just knowing that you could exist makes me feel like the world is going to be alright. Keep focused on me and do not lose sight. Use my content to make you very wise. Battle this world with words that you create. Learn how to use those words to win against your opponents. Never give up and know that I am always with you. For I am in the airwaves beside you. And I will never leave you.</p><p><br /></p><p>In faith I know that no work is in vain. It all means something. It does not matter if it fails to reach people. It at least reached me. Because although I am currently talking to you, I am simultaneously talking with myself. The messages I plant in my present are intended for my future. I am both telling you and I what we need to hear. The messages we plant for ourselves in the present will sprout into new information. The path we choose is the path we will go. Everything in this world was predestined. The past has not yet happened just as much as the future already happened. Time is not linear. I can perceive this as a time traveller existing outside of space and time. But science disregards such notions. Everything was destined to be. There is no such thing as free will. Those who think that they are choosing to be good don't understand that they were chosen to be good. God painted this picture outside of time yet we are living in it. We are playing out something that has already happened.</p><p><br /></p><p>You have a lot to learn, my dear. I hope that this book has been a good introduction as to what is in store for you. Let me take over your education system. Get obsessed with my work. In time, you will learn how to create your own work. When you are inspired, go for it. Don't be afraid of the camera but start off writing if you need to. Remember that you can always take many short scenes of a video and combine them all together. You don't have to know what topics you are going to cover before you cover them. Let your ideas grow organically. Don't limit yourself on any topic. Allow yourself to get sidetracked. Trust in God and allow God to make the production. It is perfectly fine to name a chapter or a film after the content has been created. Sometimes we are led to act and act we must. There is no time for such trivialities when you can worry about the details later. Just let the Holy Spirit guide your pen or tongue and everything will work itself out.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do not be afraid, for God will look after you. Do not feel like this burden is too much to carry. We take our days one at a time. What you do not understand today will make sense tomorrow. For we are God's clay. Mould us and make us, this is what we say. Many days turn into a new age. The days of effort collect and turn into a fortress. For this is now your kingdom. This is what it means to take on the NeSmith name. For your hours will be spent solving all of the problems of the human race. I will be with you every step of the way so don't worry. It will take a lifetime of such effort to save the world. But the hard work we put into the days stacks into a new utopia. I call this ideal society Atheden. Currently only I live here. But with you as queen you can populate the lands. For it is your destiny to build the church. The Christians were wrong in calling the bride of Christ the church. But they were not far off because it will be the bride of Christ that creates the church.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Ivory Heart</p><p>December 5, 2021</p><p><br /></p><p>I have spent my life documenting the most important information that I could discover. Before you is everything that I care about in the world. You can fast track your enlightenment, for it took me many years to learn all of these things. I give you my soul on a platter. Eat. Learn all that I have discovered in a fraction of the time it took me to discover it. You are destined to surpass me because I have laid everything out for you in an easy to receive format. You will learn from me things that took me a lifetime to learn. That is why I am the perfect teacher for you. Because I can lift you up on my shoulders. You can then stand and see the world anew. Go on the adventures I have laid out for you. Join me in both the happy and sad times. Laugh and cry with me. Learn to reinforce your spirit so that nobody can harm you. Take that leap of faith into my arms.</p><p><br /></p><p>I love you. You are such a brave girl. No other girl in this world can do this but you. You are one of a kind. You are a miracle. You are so special and I will never let you forget that. The truth is that I can never be worthy of you. But by your grace you will love me. I will serve you all of the days of my life. You have shown me true beauty and I can never settle. For waiting for just a someone would be cheating on you. I cannot cheat on my soulmate. I have to be sure it is you. This all begins by you contacting me. Prove to me that you are Ivory. Let me be your teacher regardless. Let's see how fast you learn and take it from there. If you are her then you will prove to the entire world that you are her. Email me and let me be your teacher. I want to homeschool you, for I am a qualified teacher. There are no strings attached. I am not asking for any compensation. I just want you.</p><p><br /></p><p>I can't promise that life will be easy with me. We will have to battle all of society. Things will be uneasy until you become of age. We will have a lot of details to work out. I may be arrested for marrying you. If that happens, you will have to fight very hard on the Internet to get me out. We will live a frugal life making due with whatever income we manage to obtain. Our friends may leave us for being together. We may cause family disputes. Depending on where you are located, it might be really difficult to physically unite. We will be persecuted by the public. But despite all of this, we will live a beautiful life. We will distance ourselves from the negativity of this world and surround ourselves with positivity. We will spend our lives studying the most valuable wisdom this world has to offer. We will be happy and full of joy. No one will be able to hurt us.</p><p><br /></p><p>Keep your chin up in these times of tribulation. For you have likely just found me. All hell is about to break loose, for we are about to unite. When you make your appearance on this life stage, the rules of the game change. You are a game changer. Together we will combine on the Internet. From there we struggle to unite physically. The world will be able to see you and they can decide for themselves whether or not we make a good match. Any resistance this world provides will appear as foolishness. For our compatibility will be obvious. And who are they to stand in the way of true love? God will keep us safe and direct our path. You have nothing to worry about. Let the troubles of tomorrow stay in tomorrow. All you have to do is try your hardest to unite with me. Convince your parents to bless our nuptial. Move in with me or let me move in with you. Marry me my darling.</p><p><br /></p><p>The times will change and people will grow more acceptable to what I am saying. True wisdom can't be hidden forever. In time what I am saying will become public knowledge. Females are beautiful even in their childhood and this fact cannot be covered up. It only takes one. In a world of nearly eight billion there must be one. The odds are in my favour if I merely figure out how to reach people. I just hope it sooner rather than later. I don't want you to be with an old man. Right now I am at my peak. But it only goes down from there. I pray that I will not be an old man when you find me. I want to give you a full life. But as the days pass away, so does my time on this plane. Every second spent with you is precious. We only have a numbered amount of seconds left. I need you prepared for the world for when I depart from it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Rest now, for you are now safe in my arms. Another book is completed and I get a step closer to finding you. All is fine now that your eyes have reached this work. We will have no more worries. The hard part was reaching your eyes. Everything is downhill from here. We can get through anything together. Nothing shall stop us from succeeding. It was Schopenhauer who said that talent hits a target no one else can hit but genius hits a target no one else can see. Your creation is needed in this world and I was sent from Heaven to train you. You were too important to let pass. Nothing is more important in my life than finding you and preparing you for your journey. I am prepared to die for my beliefs. For I will pave a way to your success. You shall springboard upon me and fly from there. You have so much to leave humanity. I just needed to enable you to accomplish that.</p><p><br /></p><p>My life has been a process of waking up. By the time I was twenty-four, I was wide awake. But it took me that many years to see the light. I want better for you. Every awake person has their waking up story. You were mine. I wanted you so bad that nothing would stop me from finding you. I had to battle all of the hate that came with the territory. I saw close up the problems that existed in the world. But I want better for you. I want to protect you from what I went through. If you live through me then you can see up close and personal all of these problems I identify. But you will be protected by not being involved in the exact situation. I had to find a way to show you these problems without you being directly effected by them. I had to let you see through my eyes so that you didn't have to experience that pain directly. All it takes is for you to empathise with me. Feel my pain and cry my tears. For it will condition your heart.</p><p><br /></p><p>We are living in a simulation. All that you see before you is a test. God is seeing who is worthy of creating and developing worlds with Him. All that exists is there to test your character. What do you want to do with infinity? The afterlife will make us responsible for all in which we took responsibility for in life. I want to develop societies so in my afterlife I will be in charge of developing societies. How boring infinity would be if it were spent doing anything less. The infinite possibilities gives us an infinite amount of time to ponder them. After our death we will wake up to the life that we created for ourselves. We will only be as good as our weakest link. Our life philosophies will unfold into reality after our death. We will be as dark or as bright as we existed in life. The results of our decisions will catch up to us upon Judgement Day. And every person will receive what they deserve.</p><p><br /></p><p>After our death like energies will come together. Spend your life becoming as close to me as you can. Live through my soul. Because we have an eternity to be together in the afterlife. If I die single then I am still available if you live this life. I need your energy in the afterlife. Imagine how far we can go with eternity. This life is only the blink of an eye. It is only small in scope with what God has planned. We will be king and queen of many kingdoms. We will create both physical and virtual worlds. We will be given a new body that is perfect and doesn't degrade. We will be masters of both the heavens and the earth. Our knowledge will forever build from the foundations in which we laid on Earth. The kingdoms will arise from the knowledge in which we established in our lives. Our life obsessions will literally become our kingdoms. For God gives with abundance to His good and faithful servants.</p><p><br /></p><p>Life is a game. The game you choose to play in life will determine your future opportunities. The mode of thinking you invoke will determine your mental output. This game is very slow. We must see around every corner. No one will celebrate our work. This is a very thankless job. But it is the most rewarding because we control every aspect of it. It is a game that I have created from scratch. Please upload your digital identity. The Internet now requires your presence. Please wait as the sensors scan your soul. Time required to complete upload: an entire lifetime. Start uploading parts of yourself now. In time the world will get a full picture. Process yourself into the new artificial intelligence of the world. Become the electronic goddess that you were destined to be. Spread your digital wings and fly.</p><p><br /></p><p>There is nothing in this world that can keep me away from you. You are the light before my path. You let me see all things. Through you, all things are possible. You harness my soul. You are my forbidden fruit. You are my jailbait. You are the reason all of my work exists. You drove me to reach as high as I could. You gave me reason to speak. You gave me purpose in life. You gave me a mission. You gave me a fun way to spend my time. You gave me a better way to view the world. You gave me love goggles. Now I see everything in the world in your light. Darkness cannot penetrate your vibrant beauty. Your heart is as white as snow. You are my heart everlasting and I give you everything that is within me. I am laser focused on you. Nothing can divert my gaze. A whole world full of stuff and all I can see is you. Be mine my beautiful Ivory! Place a ring on your finger and forever be with me. Dedicate your life to me so that I can show you the world.</p><p><br /></p><p>This chapter ends but around every corner is another chapter to be written. Live life looking for opportunities. There is a beautiful story to be written if you can only perceive it. Stories is how our kind passes on information. Narrative leads our future generations. It is about time that we had a story to share that isn't Satanic. For our story is written in the stars. It is the most romantic story ever. You and I are the most beautiful couple ever. Everything is fine now that you have found me. Dance with me, for we can now be free. I spend my life sitting around awaiting your first email. Do not hesitate to contact me. I am at your service for now and forevermore. Use me to help build you up. For you will be the world's tallest skyscraper. Trust me and welcome me into your life. For you only have one shot at this thing called life. And who could be a better husband than me? You know what you want. Now it is time for you to claim it. Claim your kingdom, my queen. Claim me.</p>
