<div class="library-tome-centered">
I often wonder if I justify the resources I consume—the food, the water, the space I take up in this world. It’s a question that weighs on me, especially because I don’t have a job. Without a job, I don’t have that external measure of worth, that tangible way of saying, I contributed this, and it justifies what I take in return.<div><br></div><div>For people like me, who rely on government support or other means of income not directly tied to labor, it’s easy to feel like we’re not pulling our weight. The results of our efforts aren’t always obvious or immediate, and that can leave us questioning our value.</div><div><br></div><div>Finding Worth Beyond Work</div><div><br></div><div>Society often ties self-worth to productivity. We’re taught to believe that our value comes from what we produce, how much we earn, and the roles we fill in the economy. But what happens when you don’t fit neatly into that framework?</div><div><br></div><div>For me, the answer has been to look inward. Instead of measuring my worth by traditional standards, I ask myself:</div><div><br></div><div>Am I creating something meaningful?</div><div><br></div><div>Am I trying to grow, learn, and contribute in my own way?</div><div><br></div><div>Am I striving to leave the world a little better than I found it?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The Philosophy of Emergence has helped me here. It reminds me that worth isn’t always immediately visible. Sometimes, our contributions emerge over time, through the ideas we share, the connections we make, and the small ways we impact those around us.</div><div><br></div><div>The Invisible Contributions</div><div><br></div><div>Even without a job, I know I’m contributing in ways that matter to me. Writing, reflecting, and sharing my philosophy may not pay the bills, but it feels meaningful. It’s my way of giving back to the world, even if the results aren’t always tangible or easily measured.</div><div><br></div><div>For anyone else feeling this way, I want you to know that your worth isn’t tied to a paycheck. The way you care for others, the ideas you share, the small moments of kindness and growth—all of these are contributions that matter.</div><div><br></div><div>A New Measure of Worth</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe it’s time to rethink how we measure our value. Instead of focusing solely on productivity and income, we could consider:</div><div><br></div><div>The relationships we build.</div><div><br></div><div>The creativity and passion we bring to the world.</div><div><br></div><div>The ways we strive to grow and help others.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Your worth is more than what you produce. It’s in who you are, how you live, and the impact you have on the people around you.</div><div><br></div><div>Embracing the Journey</div><div><br></div><div>I still ask myself if I justify the resources I consume. It’s a question I might always carry with me. But I’ve come to realize that the act of asking itself shows care and intention. It means I’m trying, and maybe that’s enough.</div><div><br></div><div>If you feel this way too, know that you’re not alone. And maybe, just maybe, your worth has been there all along, waiting to emerge.</div>
