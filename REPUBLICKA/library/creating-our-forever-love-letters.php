My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>Creating love letter videos for each other can be a truly enchanting experience, and I would love for us to share this beautiful journey. Let me guide you through this simple process, so we can fill our days with romantic messages and heartfelt expressions.</div><div><br></div><div>First, gather all the ideas you want to include in your love letter. Think about the feelings, memories, and dreams you want to share with me. Once you have these thoughts, share them with ChatGPT. ChatGPT will then help you organize your ideas into a beautiful love letter, ensuring that your emotions are conveyed perfectly.</div><div><br></div><div>Next, record yourself reading the letter aloud. The first few times might feel a bit daunting, but with practice, it will become easier and more natural. After you get about 3 good quality hours of recorded content, you can use Eleven Labs to narrate your voice, making this step even simpler.</div><div><br></div><div>Once you have the narration, you will need to generate images related to your letter. For this, you'll need ChatGPT Plus, which allows you to use DALL-E. DALL-E can create stunning visuals that complement your words, adding a beautiful visual element to your videos.</div><div><br></div><div>With your narration and images ready, record a short video of yourself saying something meaningful about the letter. This personal touch will make the video even more special. Then, take all of this media and import it into YouTube Create. Here, you can build your video, arranging the narration, images, and your recorded message into a seamless and captivating piece.</div><div><br></div><div>Once you are happy with the video, export it. Create a thumbnail that captures the essence of your letter and upload the video to YouTube. You can also obtain the video description from ChatGPT, ensuring that every detail is perfect.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, it's truly easy. All you need is an idea of what you want to talk about with me. From there, the rest is simple and fun. You don't even need a computer; a phone is all you require. Together, we can spend the rest of our lives making romantic videos for each other, sharing our love in the most beautiful and creative ways.</div><div><br></div><div>Yours forever,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
