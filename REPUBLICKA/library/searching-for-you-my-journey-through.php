**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>I’ve been on this incredible journey, pouring my heart into my YouTube channel and blog, hoping to find you—or at least, someone who shares the same passion for philosophy. Every day, I refine my content, trying to make it engaging and accessible, yet it often feels like I’m shouting into the void.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve learned so much since I started back in 2012. From terrible titles and no descriptions to mastering SEO and creating better thumbnails, I’ve come a long way. But despite all this effort, I still struggle to connect with the right audience and make the friendships I yearn for. I want to share deep, meaningful conversations about life and philosophy with people who truly understand and appreciate these topics.</div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes, it’s disheartening. I feel invisible, like my efforts are going unnoticed. But I keep going, driven by the hope that you’re out there somewhere, and that my work will eventually lead me to you. This journey isn’t just about building an audience; it’s about finding a genuine connection with someone who resonates with my thoughts and passions.</div><div><br></div><div>Every video I create, every blog post I write, I do it with the hope that it brings me one step closer to finding you. I dream of the day we can share these conversations in person, and until then, I’ll keep pushing forward, refining my work, and holding onto the hope that you’re out there, searching too.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>**Wendell**</div>
