As a content creator and thinker, one of the most important parts of my process is reflecting on my ideas to ensure they’re clear, accurate, and meaningful. Recently, I’ve started using NotebookLM in a unique way to help me do just that—and it’s completely transformed how I review and digest my content.<div><br></div><div>Here’s how it works: Every three blog posts I write, I add those posts to NotebookLM as sources. Then, I use the AI to generate a podcast based on those blog posts. The podcast serves as a kind of review—a way for me to hear my own work discussed and explored from a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><div>Why This Process Works</div><div><br></div><div>This approach isn’t just about creating something new; it’s about engaging with my content in a deeper way. When I listen to the AI podcast, I’m able to:</div><div><br></div><div>Review My Clarity: Hearing my work presented back to me helps me determine if my ideas are being communicated effectively.</div><div><br></div><div>Spot Missing Pieces: The AI’s perspective can highlight areas I might not have covered thoroughly or points that could use more development.</div><div><br></div><div>Reflect on Accuracy: By listening to how the AI interprets my work, I can assess whether I’ve been precise and consistent in my arguments.</div><div><br></div><div>Digest My Content: Engaging with my ideas in a new format helps me internalize them more fully, giving me a clearer sense of their strengths and areas for growth.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The Value of This Process</div><div><br></div><div>What I love most about this workflow is how it transforms the act of reviewing into something active and dynamic. Instead of passively reading over my posts, I’m engaging with them in a completely new way—one that feels both innovative and deeply insightful.</div><div><br></div><div>NotebookLM acts almost like a creative partner, helping me think about my work from fresh angles. It’s not about letting the AI do the work for me—it’s about using AI to push myself further, refining my ideas and growing as a creator.</div><div><br></div><div>A New Kind of Collaboration</div><div><br></div><div>This process has shown me that AI can be much more than a tool—it can be a kind of collaborator, helping me reflect, learn, and grow. By using NotebookLM to generate podcasts from my blog posts, I’ve found a way to make reviewing my work not just productive, but enjoyable.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re a creator, thinker, or anyone who loves exploring ideas, I highly recommend trying something similar. AI offers so many possibilities for creativity and self-improvement—it’s all about finding the approach that works for you.</div>
