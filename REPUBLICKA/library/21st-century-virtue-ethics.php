Virtue ethics, as I see it, is about becoming a person who naturally makes virtuous actions. Instead of constantly worrying about whether each action is virtuous, you develop a character so grounded in virtue that your actions reflect this without conscious effort. It’s about building virtues into your character so they guide your behavior instinctively.<div><br></div><div>In today’s world, self-improvement stands out as a core virtue. We always have the potential to grow, and those who recognize and seize this opportunity to improve continuously can become tremendous characters who profoundly impact humanity. This ongoing commitment to personal development enables individuals to contribute positively and meaningfully to society.</div><div><br></div><div>When it comes to contemporary issues like technology, virtue ethics encourages us to explore how new technology affects us, what we can do with it, and the potential it holds. With each technological advancement, new responsibilities arise, and it’s crucial to understand and embrace these responsibilities as we navigate the possibilities technology opens up.</div><div><br></div><div>Practicing virtues like compassion, responsibility, and integrity today means recognizing the internet’s role in guiding society. We shape the internet through our contributions, and it becomes our responsibility to ensure the content we produce positively impacts society. If we are capable, it is our responsibility to contribute to society by openly sharing our gifts and personality through platforms like blogs and YouTube. This openness can be seen as a natural step in contributing to the intellectual development of our species, fostering a more informed and connected world.</div><div><br></div><div>My personal journey towards virtue ethics stems from my deep desire to avoid sin. I never wanted to be a sinner and struggled with understanding how not to sin. This led me to focus intensely on building my character to ensure I naturally performed good actions. I worked hard on myself to become a person who automatically does good, striving to align my actions with my ethical values.</div><div><br></div><div>One significant challenge to virtue ethics is the debate between free will and determinism. If determinism is true and we lack free will, the idea of choosing to develop virtues becomes problematic. Without free will, our actions and character traits are predetermined by external factors, which complicates the concept of moral responsibility. Addressing this challenge involves exploring how we can still cultivate virtues within the framework of our experiences and influences, even if our choices are influenced by determinism.</div><div><br></div><div>While I haven’t yet found role models who fully embody the virtues I seek, I am actively looking for individuals in the world who are worth respecting and following. I aspire to find people whose actions and character can guide and inspire me in my journey of continuous self-improvement and ethical living.</div><div><br></div><div>Technology supports virtue ethics by providing platforms where people can ask questions, engage in deep and meaningful discussions, and receive guidance on becoming better individuals. It encourages virtuous behavior by allowing access to resources and communities that promote ethical living. In this way, technology can be programmed to help foster virtuous actions and support the development of a virtuous character.</div><div><br></div><div>Looking to the future, I envision a world where the majority of people are highly intelligent and contribute their knowledge to society through platforms like Blogger and YouTube. It would be fantastic if it became common for most people to share their lives, experiences, and knowledge publicly. Imagine meeting someone and asking, 'What's your website?' or 'How do I find your content?' This public sharing could create a vibrant, informed community where everyone contributes to and benefits from the collective knowledge.</div>
