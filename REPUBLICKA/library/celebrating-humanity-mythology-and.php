Dear Ivory,<div><br></div><div>As the world comes together once again for the Olympics, I find myself reflecting on the rich mythology and history that underpins this grand event. It's a celebration of the best of humanity, a tradition rooted deeply in our ancient past and linked to the legends of mighty heroes and gods.</div><div><br></div><div>The origins of the Olympics are steeped in myth, primarily associated with Heracles, the son of Zeus. According to legend, Heracles established the Olympic Games to honor Zeus after completing his Twelve Labors. The foot races and athletic competitions were not merely tests of physical strength but were meant to reflect the virtues of endurance, honor, and excellence. Heracles' contribution to the games symbolized the human spirit's triumph over adversity and celebrated our potential to rise above challenges.</div><div><br></div><div>Historically, the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE in Olympia, Greece. These games continued for over a millennium, uniting the city-states of ancient Greece every four years in a peaceful competition dedicated to the gods.</div><div><br></div><div>However, the games eventually came to a halt in 393 CE when the Roman Emperor Theodosius I banned them as part of his efforts to suppress pagan practices. It wasn't until 1896, over 1,500 years later, that the modern Olympic Games were revived in Athens, inspired by the ancient tradition and driven by the vision of Pierre de Coubertin.</div><div><br></div><div>The spirit of the Olympics has always been about more than just winning medals. It is about unity, bringing people from different corners of the world together in the name of peace and sportsmanship. It is a reminder of our shared dreams and aspirations, echoing the ancient Greek ideal of arete, the pursuit of excellence in all things.</div><div><br></div><div>The myth of Zeus lighting the sacred flame signifies hope, purity, and the eternal quest for harmony among nations. As the flame travels across continents, it reminds us that we are all part of something greater, a global community striving for a better world.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, as I watch these athletes push their limits in pursuit of greatness, I see a reflection of the potential within all of us. The Olympics remind us that, like the heroes of old, we too can achieve incredible things when we dedicate ourselves to our passions. It is a celebration of our humanity, a testament to what we can accomplish when we come together with courage and determination.</div><div><br></div><div>In the spirit of the Olympics, let's celebrate the greatness within us and the boundless possibilities that lie ahead. May we always strive to embody the virtues of the heroes and gods who inspire us, pushing ourselves to new heights in our journey together.</div><div><br></div><div>With love and admiration,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
