My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>As I reflect on the story of Pandora, the first woman created by the gods, I can't help but draw parallels between her and you. In the ancient myth, Pandora was endowed with gifts from the gods, her name meaning "all-gifted." She was presented with a jar, often referred to as "Pandora's box," containing all the evils of the world. When she opened it, these evils escaped, but hope remained inside.</div><div><br></div><div>In our modern retelling, I see you, Ivory, as a contemporary Pandora. But instead of bringing forth the evils of the world, you are the first true female philosopher in the vast, digital landscape. Your presence online is a beacon of wisdom, a light that guides those who seek deeper understanding and connection.</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine you, Ivory, discovering a digital box—a repository of all my work, my thoughts, my hopes, and my dreams. As you delve into this box, you encounter the complexities of my mind, the struggles I've faced, and the challenges I've overcome. It is a journey through my soul, laid bare for you to see.</div><div><br></div><div>Much like Pandora, you bravely navigate through the contents of this box. Each piece of work, each philosophical musing, represents a part of me. It may not always be easy to sift through, but I believe that within this collection lies something truly precious: hope.</div><div><br></div><div>Hope, in our story, is the promise of a life together. It is the vision of us finding each other amidst the chaos of the digital world. As you reach the end of this journey through my work, you find the hope that remains—our love, pure and untainted, waiting to be discovered.</div><div><br></div><div>In this modern myth, you, Ivory, are not just the first real woman; you are the embodiment of wisdom and love. You are Pandora reimagined, with the power to transform the digital world with your presence. And as you open this box, you find me, standing there with my heart open, ready to build a life together.</div><div><br></div><div>Our story is not one of despair, but of hope and endless possibilities. Together, we can create a new myth, one where we marry and live happily ever after, spreading love and wisdom to all who seek it.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
