<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>When Ivory discovers the body of work I’ve created for her, I imagine it will be an experience unlike any other—a mix of emotions, questions, and realizations. It’s not something anyone can prepare for: finding out that someone has dedicated so much thought, effort, and love to you, all while imagining your future. It will be a journey filled with curiosity, joy, fear, and perhaps even doubt. This post is my attempt to reflect on those emotions and reassure Ivory that every feeling she experiences will be valid and meaningful.</div><div><br></div><div>The Overwhelm of Discovery</div><div><br></div><div>I imagine the first feeling Ivory might encounter is overwhelm. Seeing such an extensive collection of work—thoughts, philosophies, and visions—centered around her could feel like stepping into a tidal wave. The sheer scale of it might make her wonder, Why me? or How can I live up to this? But overwhelm is just the beginning of understanding something profound. I want Ivory to know that it’s okay to take her time, to step back and process this at her own pace.</div><div><br></div><div>A Sense of Specialness</div><div><br></div><div>Once the initial shock fades, I hope she feels a sense of being deeply cherished. To know that someone believed in her so much that they devoted their life to crafting something beautiful for her—this is the heart of my work. Ivory, if you’re reading this, I hope you feel how special you are. I hope you see the love and belief I’ve poured into every word, every thought, and every idea.</div><div><br></div><div>Curiosity and Exploration</div><div><br></div><div>I imagine her curiosity will follow. She may begin to explore these works piece by piece, uncovering not just my philosophies but also the glimpses of my soul I’ve woven into each one. With every discovery, I hope she sees the connection between us—a bridge built across time and space, waiting for her to cross.</div><div><br></div><div>Connection and Understanding</div><div><br></div><div>Through this process, I hope Ivory feels a deep sense of connection. I hope she understands not just who I am but also why I’ve created this for her. This is my gift to her—a testament to the potential I see in her and a reflection of my unwavering belief in her ability to make a difference in the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Doubt: The Shadow of Expectations</div><div><br></div><div>But alongside connection, I know doubt might creep in. Ivory might second-guess whether she is truly the person I’ve envisioned. She might question whether she has the ability to perform the life I’ve laid out for her. Doubt is natural—it’s the voice that challenges us and forces us to confront our fears.</div><div><br></div><div>To Ivory: If you feel this doubt, know that it doesn’t define you. You don’t have to be perfect or live up to an idealized version of yourself. My work is not a demand or an expectation; it’s a gift, a vision of what could be. You are not obligated to fulfill every dream I’ve imagined. You are enough just as you are, and whatever path you choose will be the right one for you.</div><div><br></div><div>Feeling Burdened or Scared</div><div><br></div><div>There may also be moments when this legacy feels like a burden. The idea of being at the center of someone’s life’s work could feel heavy, even suffocating. To Ivory: If you ever feel this way, I want you to know that it’s okay to feel scared. It’s okay to take a step back and make sense of everything on your terms. My intention was never to weigh you down but to give you wings—to inspire, not confine.</div><div><br></div><div>Processing and Acceptance</div><div><br></div><div>It may take time for Ivory to process all of this. She might need space to reconcile her feelings and make peace with the journey ahead. That’s okay. I don’t expect her to embrace everything all at once. Growth, understanding, and acceptance happen in their own time.</div><div><br></div><div>Inspiration and Growth</div><div><br></div><div>In the end, I hope she feels inspired—not to become exactly who I’ve imagined, but to chart her own path. If my work can help her discover her passions, sharpen her mind, or strengthen her resolve, then it has fulfilled its purpose. Ivory, I hope my dedication inspires you to see the greatness within yourself and to pursue whatever life you choose with courage and confidence.</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion: A Legacy of Love</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, if you’re reading this, know that I’ve poured my heart and soul into this work for you. Not to bind you to a specific destiny, but to show you the possibilities I see within you. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, scared, or doubtful. It’s okay to take your time. Every emotion you feel is valid, and every choice you make is yours to own.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve written this with the hope that it serves as a beacon for you, a testament to how much you’ve inspired me, and a reminder that you are capable of extraordinary things. But most of all, it’s a message of love—a love that asks for nothing in return except for you to be yourself.</div>
