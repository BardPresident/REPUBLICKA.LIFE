<div class="library-tome-centered">
I am not going to find the love of my life on dating apps. I want a woman to engage with philosophical ideas with me. Dating apps were not made for the content producer. I can get seen by more people by just sharing my ideas than I can in a dating app. I get more exposure making content than a dating app could ever provide. Because the dating app is not based off of ideas, it is based off of images of yourself. I can provide ideas and images of myself through video. I will never find my philosophy queen on a dating app. I will stop using dating apps as soon as my subscriptions run out.<div><br></div><div>If I am to find my philosophy queen, I need to capture her through my ideas. I need to transform her world. I need to be the thing in life that she has always been looking for. I do not think that I will yet give up my pursuit to find this lady. I just can't have my whole life riding on it. If I find her, great. But if I do not, then that is fine too. I need to be able to accept all possibilities in life. I wouldn't close off potential just because I don't think it likely. Plus, I still have time to have a family. As a man, I don't lose my fertility. And I am a special person. Any girl would be lucky to be with me. I think females who are serious about living a meaningful life will not concern themselves over something as trivial as age.</div><div><br></div><div>I have always been so much all or nothing. In my life I had to have it all or nothing. This isn't a good way to look at life because of you fail, there are no other options. You can't live your life fighting for only one outcome. You must fight for all the outcomes that you care about. And I care about love. So even though most of my audience are male, I still do reach some females. And if I just continue to do this all of the days of my life, then it is possible that I may come across an attractive female who is also passionate about these subjects. It could happen. But females tend not to be very interested in philosophy so maybe it won't happen. But all I can do is try.</div><div><br></div><div>My work will no longer be driven by finding a partner. Instead, I will just share my soul because I love doing that. I will focus on all the aspects of life that I love most. My life is mine to live! I don't have the burdens of having physical friends. My time is my own because no one else wants to use me. So what shall I do with all of this free time? I don't have a job. What shall I do now that Ivory is no longer my guiding light? My guiding light has changed multiple times over my life. It used to be Jesus. Now I am becoming my own guiding light. Light emanates from within me. I no longer need idealised personifications to guide my life. I can now see my direction clearly as a single individual.</div><div><br></div><div>God is a very attractive concept for lonely people. The idea of having another there with you makes life feel a little less lonely. Knowing that every action you take, God or Jesus or Ivory is right there with you by your side makes life a more pleasant experience. But this is deluding yourself into believing falsehoods. There is no all powerful being watching my existence. When I am alone, I am alone and there is no one out there who is experiencing these feelings with me. That is true for your average individual, but I spent my life becoming like God. Many on the Internet come to me to experience my feelings. I am everywhere.</div><div><br></div><div>So my loneliness is different than your average individual. Because I interact with a lot of people on a day to day basis. I am a public figure, although not very well known. But despite only being a small creator, I still reach a lot of people. So how can I be lonely when many other people experience my emotions? Just because they did not reach out does not mean that they did not enjoy the experience. Not many people reach out anyways. And I am only interested in the people interested in making content. And most people are not interested in making content so I am not interested in them. But I stand as an example to explore the types of things you can achieve by doing this. And hopefully I will encourage other people to try it out and see what they think.</div><div><br></div><div>One thing that I hate about flow is that you cannot always control it. I can't always come to the keyboard and expect to write. It takes a lot of preparation to be able to write like this. That means long periods just sitting down and doing nothing. Ideas take time to be formed and cannot be forced. But once the ideas have developed a little, then I can begin to form their practical application. My diary is so cool because I can come to it just with a thought and then that thought turns into an entire philosophy, like with the superfriends idea. This is an idea that has been growing in me for a long time and it just needed time to reach its maturation. Now I know exactly what I want out of life. Yes it is true that my dreams still depend on other people, but I have the rest of my life to recruit people so it is possible.</div><div><br></div><div>What is a long term goal? In my past work I created a fake university and attempted to find other open source teachers. I found none, but I stood as an example of what an open source teacher is. I dropped the entire student teacher persona. I am a human and you are a human. You can learn from me and I can learn from you, if you create content. The academic facade was not one worthy of retaining. I am a qualified educator. I could have worked in the schooling system if I really wanted to. But now I talk to you as an equal, not as a teacher. Is philosophy truly best learned in an academic environment? Do we really need roles to teach philosophy? What is it that my teacher truly knows that I don't know? How can my teacher teach me if they are not my friend?</div><div><br></div><div>It is really important the people you choose to learn from in this life. If my teacher does not want to be my friend, then there is nothing valuable in which they can teach me. I want friends as my teachers. People who I look up to and respect. Role models to help guide me through life. And if a teacher cannot be a friend then they are not interested in what is best for your future. Why would you learn from them? Our schooling system is backwards. People should be seeking out others who can benefit their lives. This is modern education. I don't have to endure twenty-six years of learning from people who don't care about me. Forcing me to do this is not looking after my best interest. Forcing a curriculum on me is not in my best interest.</div><div><br></div><div>I am a mere example of the types of possibilities that you can achieve by documenting your own thoughts. The limits is your imagination. Because both text and video allows you to be very expressive. I didn't want to be the teacher so I became just a guy showing off the potential of expressive technology when applied philosophically. Use my content to assist you when thinking about how you can document your own thoughts and feelings. That is the goal after all. To convince you to become my entertainment. I am so very bored and there is so very little meaning to be found in the world. Quench my thirst and act! This world is a show. Your life is a show. Capture it for me to watch and read. Capture it for yourself to experience.</div>
