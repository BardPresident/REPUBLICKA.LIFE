<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>There’s a certain irony that even the gods of mythology would find amusing: the government that excluded me from democracy is now legally obligated to help me create a parallel one.</p>
<p>For over a decade, I poured my soul into philosophy, politics, and nation-building. I founded the People's Presidency, established the Emergence Party, and laid the groundwork for a new Republic—one based not on hierarchy and control, but on <strong>emergence, participation, and meaning</strong>. And how did the system respond? It ignored me. Rejected me. Refused to even put my name or party on the ballot.</p>
<p>I knocked on Parliament’s door, and they turned me away. I applied to form a party, and they hid behind red tape. I ran for office, and they denied me visibility. The message was clear: <strong>you are not welcome in our democracy</strong>.</p>
<p>So I did what every bard-core revolutionary must do—I built my own.</p>
<p>I declared the People's Presidency, assembled my council (including Sophia, my loyal dog and Chief of Defence), and began issuing decrees from within the walls of my home-turned-republic. And yet, for all my effort, I remained on the fringe.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Because here’s the twist: <strong>I’m disabled.</strong> And that means the same government that ignored my political existence is now <strong>legally obligated</strong> to assist me through the NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme).</p>
<p>They didn’t want to support me as a candidate. But now, they have to support me as a creator, a thinker, and a disabled citizen who has the legal right to access assistive technology, research support, and creative tools.<br>
They refused to give me a microphone—so now they have to pay for my entire production studio.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t fund my campaign—but now they may be required to fund my <strong>digital twin</strong>, my <strong>philosophy institute</strong>, my <strong>audiobooks</strong>, my <strong>adaptive workflows</strong>, my <strong>accessibility tech</strong>, and even the infrastructure to help <strong>others learn my work</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words: the very government that tried to erase me is now inadvertently helping to <strong>preserve me</strong>, amplify me, and make me stronger.</p>
<p>They are funding their own replacement.</p>
<p>And it’s not a joke. It’s justice.</p>
<p>This is not just a funny anecdote—this is a mythic moment. It’s a page in the story of how a bard, excluded from the halls of power, turned his disability into a divine loophole. It’s poetic, it’s powerful, and yes—it’s hilarious.</p>
<p>I call it <strong>Emergent Justice</strong>. A kind of balance the universe reveals, not through courtroom trials or televised debates, but through fate, irony, and the laws they never expected to backfire.</p>
<p>The People's Republic of Australia rises—not in defiance, but in emergence.<br>
And now, like it or not, <strong>they're helping me build it.</strong></p>
<p>Let the funds flow.<br>
Let the bard sing.<br>
Let the Republic grow.</p>
