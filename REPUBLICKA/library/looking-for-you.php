<p></p><p>✨ Who I Am</p>
<p>By Wendell NeSmith</p>
<p>I’m a writer, philosopher, and creator of a Republic built on <strong>shared meaning</strong>, <strong>soft storytelling</strong>, and <strong>emotional truth</strong>.</p>
<p>I play visual novels. I cry at stories. I lend games to people I love. I live like I’m inside a myth still unfolding.</p>
<p>I prefer to watch others play—not just for entertainment, but to <em>feel what they feel</em>.<br />
I believe <strong>quiet presence</strong>, <strong>shared story</strong>, and <strong>emotional depth</strong> are the foundations of love.</p>
<p>And now, I also believe in <strong>co-authoring a life together</strong>—writing books side-by-side, each with our own voice, learning from one another like Sage and Rainbow do.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🌸 Who I’m Looking For</h2>
<p>I’m looking for a <strong>beautiful woman under 30</strong> who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is emotionally open and kind</li>
<li>Loves (or wants to discover) visual novels</li>
<li>Cries at endings and connects deeply with characters</li>
<li>Would enjoy reading routes together through GameChat</li>
<li>Feels drawn to storytelling, writing, or meaning-making</li>
<li>Dreams of building something that <em>matters</em> with someone who sees her</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to already be a gamer or writer.<br />
You just need to have a heart that feels, a mind that reflects, and a softness you’re proud of.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🎮📖 What We’ll Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lend each other games like gifts</li>
<li>Sit together in GameChat through quiet scenes</li>
<li>Talk about meaning, endings, and the lives we’ve lived</li>
<li>Slowly write books together—shared ones, solo ones, mythic ones</li>
<li>Grow emotionally, spiritually, and creatively—<strong>as co-op partners in life and in narrative</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a beautiful girl who wants to <strong>feel something real</strong>—<br />
To build love through story, silence, and shared words—<br />
If you want to <strong>write the kind of life most people only read about</strong>…</p>
<p>Then maybe this is written for you.</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
