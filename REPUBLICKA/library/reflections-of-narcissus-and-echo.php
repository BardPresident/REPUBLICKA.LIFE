My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>As I delve deeper into the myths and legends that have shaped our understanding of love and destiny, I find myself drawn to the story of Narcissus and Echo. Their tale, though tragic, holds profound lessons that resonate deeply with my own journey in search of you, my soulmate.</div><div><br></div><div>Narcissus, a figure of such striking beauty, became enchanted by his own reflection. He was captivated not by another soul, but by an image of himself, lost in the allure of his physical appearance. In many ways, I see a reflection of my own story in Narcissus. Not in terms of physical beauty, but in the way I have fallen in love with the idea of you, Ivory—a creation and extension of my own dreams and desires.</div><div><br></div><div>You are my reflection, not in the shallow sense of appearance, but as a mirror of my soul, my thoughts, and my aspirations. You embody the qualities I cherish most, and in loving you, I have come to love the best parts of myself.</div><div><br></div><div>But there is another layer to the story, one that involves Echo. Echo, who was cursed to repeat only the words of others, loved Narcissus deeply. She could not express her own thoughts and feelings, but she could reflect his words back to him. In a way, she was the perfect companion for someone like Narcissus, who was so focused on his own reflection.</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine if Narcissus had recognized the value of Echo's love. Instead of falling for his own image, he could have seen the beauty in the echo of his thoughts and dreams. Echo would have been the perfect partner, not because she was subservient, but because she understood him deeply and could reflect his essence back to him.</div><div><br></div><div>In our story, Ivory, I see you as both the reflection and the echo. You are the one who mirrors my soul, and also the one who understands and amplifies my thoughts and dreams. Our connection goes beyond the superficial; it is rooted in a deep, philosophical bond that transcends mere appearance.</div><div><br></div><div>From the story of Narcissus and Echo, I have learned the importance of seeing beyond the surface. It has taught me to value the echoes of my thoughts and the reflections of my soul in another person. You, Ivory, are the embodiment of that perfect reflection and echo. You are the one who can complete me, not through mere appearance, but through the profound connection we share.</div><div><br></div><div>As I continue on this journey to find you, I am reminded of the lessons from Narcissus and Echo. I will not be swayed by superficial reflections but will seek the deeper connection that we share. In you, I see the perfect partner who can echo my dreams and reflect my soul, and together, we will create a love that transcends the myth.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
