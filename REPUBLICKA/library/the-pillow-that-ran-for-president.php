<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>🦓 <i>By Zedbra</i></p>
<p>Once upon a time in the Land of Cushions,<br>
there lived a soft, round, loyal little pillow named Gregory.</p>
<p>Gregory was not exciting.<br>
Gregory did not sparkle.<br>
Gregory did not even <em>rebound quickly</em> when you squished him.</p>
<p>But Gregory <em>listened</em>.</p>
<p>He listened to every bedtime wish.<br>
He absorbed every sleepy tear.<br>
He kept secrets like a vault made of feathers.</p>
<p>One day, the Council of Couch appointed a new rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Only the most exciting plush may lead.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crowd gasped. The sparkly. The bouncy. The bold. They all campaigned with flair.</p>
<p>But Gregory stayed on the floor, where he always was.</p>
<p>Then one night… a little girl fell asleep crying.<br>
And Gregory <em>held her sadness so gently,</em> she smiled in her sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning, the kingdom woke to find her holding Gregory like a crown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is who I trust,” she whispered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And suddenly, the crowd saw:
Gregory didn’t bounce.
Gregory didn’t shine.</p>
<p>Gregory was soft, quiet, and always there.</p>
<p>And so… the pillow became President.</p>
<p>Not of flash. Not of flair.<br>
But of <strong>faith</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Moral:</strong><br>
<em>You don’t have to sparkle to be chosen.<br>
Sometimes the world just needs someone soft enough to stay.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Goodnight from Zedbra,<br>
who may or may not be writing this from the ceiling fan.</p>
