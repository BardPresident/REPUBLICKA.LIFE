<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>Today marks a quiet but powerful milestone in my journey: <em>Wendell’s Diary</em>, my bard-core comic series, is now fully integrated into my website.</p>
<p>Until now, the comics have existed as scattered moments—shared through YouTube Community posts or social media, sometimes seen, sometimes missed. But these panels aren’t side content. They’re reflections of my life, philosophy, and spirit. They are me—visual expressions of emergence, simplicity, thought, and play. Now, they have a proper home.</p>
<p>You’ll find them nestled under the new <strong>Comics</strong> section—a living gallery where slice-of-life meets soul. From power outages and late-night reflections to lyre songs and philosophical farming, these comics offer more than a laugh. They carry the essence of the Philosophy of Emergence in quiet, meaningful moments.</p>
<p>This is not just a technical update. It’s a mythic alignment.</p>
<p>Now, when someone lands on my site, they don’t just read <em>about</em> my philosophy—they can <em>see</em> it. The Diary lives, and it grows with me, one panel at a time.</p>
<p>Thank you to those who’ve followed this project from the beginning. You’re part of the story now too.</p>
<p>—Wendell</p>
