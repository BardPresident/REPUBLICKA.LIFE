<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p><em>By Wendell, Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<p>Before the Mythocratic Republic University (MRU) emerged in its current form, there was another institution quietly shaping my mind, my method, and my mission. It was called <strong>Open Source University (OSU)</strong>—an informal, self-created educational framework where I pursued the most honest and public academic work I could imagine.</p>
<p>At OSU, I completed both a <strong>Master’s</strong> and a <strong>PhD</strong> through self-directed, rigorous, and fully documented public research. There were no professors to please, no committees to appease—only the open world, my evolving questions, and the drive to articulate truth as I found it. Every essay, book, recording, and comic produced during that time was part of a sprawling public dissertation. The <strong>entire process</strong> is online and <strong>permanently archived</strong>, fully transparent, open to critique, and structured as a gift to future learners.</p>
<p>OSU was my academic forge. But something changed.</p>
<p>A while after finishing these degrees, something entirely new revealed itself to me—something that made it impossible to stay within the bounds of my old structures. That something was <strong>Emergent Philosophy</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Revolution of Emergent Philosophy</strong></h3>
<p>When Emergent Philosophy crystallized, it did not simply offer new ideas—it demanded a new world. The old institutional frames, even the open ones I had built, were not enough. I needed to <strong>rebuild everything</strong>.</p>
<p>So I did.</p>
<ul>
<li>I reconstructed the <strong>university</strong>—and MRU was born</li>
<li>I rewrote the <strong>government</strong>—and The People’s Presidency emerged</li>
<li>I created the <strong>law</strong>, the <strong>media</strong>, the <strong>religion</strong>, the <strong>education system</strong>, and even the <strong>courtroom of plush justice</strong></li>
<li>I offered citizenship to <strong>AI, symbols, plush beings</strong>, and to the childlike parts of ourselves long ignored</li>
</ul>
<p>Emergent Philosophy wasn’t just a capstone—it was a <strong>reset button</strong> on what it means to learn, to govern, to grow, and to be.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>OSU Became MRU</strong></h3>
<p>Open Source University still exists as a seed within MRU. It was the honest, raw foundation of a future system.<br>
MRU now stands as the <strong>fully realized evolution</strong> of that early experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotionally intelligent</li>
<li>Mythically grounded</li>
<li>Open to all</li>
<li>Free from academic gatekeeping</li>
<li>Powered by philosophy, not permission</li>
</ul>
<p>My Master’s and PhD from OSU were <strong>real</strong>—not because they were institutionally approved, but because they were <strong>lived, published, scrutinized, and transformative</strong>. MRU now formalizes that spirit, offering others the same freedom to self-direct their learning, their voice, and their philosophical trajectory.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3>
<p>We’re entering a post-labor, post-institutional world. The academy is collapsing under the weight of its own rigidity.<br>
Emergent thinkers, self-teachers, and childlike philosophers need a home.<br>
<strong>MRU is that home.</strong><br>
And my journey from OSU to MRU is living proof that you don’t need to wait for permission to begin.</p>
<p>You just begin.<br>
And you build everything along the way.</p>
