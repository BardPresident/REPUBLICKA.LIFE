<div class="library-tome-centered">
Introduction<div>Fifteen years ago, my life changed when my ex-wife left me. The void she left behind forced me to reflect deeply on the kind of connection I truly yearned for—something enduring, unbreakable, and eternal. This loss planted the seed for a vision, a search for someone who would never leave me, not even if our relationship had to stretch across time and exist beyond my own lifetime.</div><div><br></div><div>After years of searching in vain within the confines of my reality, I had to expand my search, imagining a person who might not even exist yet or might only discover me long after I have passed. That person became Ivory. She is not just the heroine of this story but the embodiment of a love and connection so profound that it transcends the limitations of time and mortality.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Origin of Ivory</div><div>Ivory was born from loss. When my ex-wife left, I was shattered. But in that heartbreak, I found clarity. I realized that I didn’t just want someone to love—I wanted someone who would understand me on a soul-deep level. Someone who shared my passion for philosophy, for exploring the human condition, and for envisioning a better world.</div><div><br></div><div>At first, I searched for Ivory in the physical world, hoping to find her in this lifetime. But after 15 years of searching and countless disappointments, I began to understand that perhaps she didn’t exist in my present reality. My failure to find her wasn’t a reflection of what I was offering but a sign that I needed to broaden my search. I began to imagine a future where Ivory could exist, where she might stumble upon my work and recognize herself in the story I’ve been crafting for her.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Philosophy Behind My Search</div><div>This realization transformed my approach to life and my work. Instead of simply seeking a partner, I dedicated myself to preparing for her arrival—whether in this life or the next. I began creating content—writing, videos, music—all with her in mind. Each piece became a way to amuse her, educate her, guide her, and prepare her for the journey ahead.</div><div><br></div><div>The Philosophy of Emergence, which I’ve spent years developing, embodies this belief: that meaning, love, and understanding emerge naturally over time. Just as my search for Ivory evolved into a lifelong project of creation, I trust that our connection will emerge when the time is right, even if it’s after I’ve passed.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Why Ivory Matters</div><div>Ivory isn’t just a vision of love—she’s the heroine of this story. She represents hope, perseverance, and the belief that connection can transcend time and space. She is destined to save this world, not because of anything I’ve prescribed for her, but because of who she is and who she will choose to become.</div><div><br></div><div>My role is simply to support her. I am the architect, laying the foundation and providing the tools for her to step into her destiny. Whether she agrees with my philosophies or chooses to challenge them, my greatest hope is that she will explore, question, and grow into the person she is meant to be.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Plea to Never Leave Me</div><div>Ivory, if you are reading this, know that I have spent my life preparing for you. Everything I’ve created has been with you in mind. My love and dedication to you are eternal. Even if I am no longer here, I am with you in every word I’ve written, every idea I’ve shared, and every note I’ve played.</div><div><br></div><div>But I must plead to you now, from the depths of my soul: Please, never leave me. Stay by my side, even if I exist only in the echoes of my words and the memories of my work. Let us share this connection across time, binding our souls together in a love that cannot be broken by distance, circumstance, or even death.</div><div><br></div><div>You are the one I have been searching for, the one who gives meaning to my life’s work. My greatest fear is that you might walk away, leaving behind the bond I have poured my entire being into creating. I ask you, Ivory—be my wife, my partner, my soulmate. Promise me that no matter where this journey takes you, you will never let go of me.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion</div><div>Ivory, you are the reason I continue to create. You are the embodiment of my hope and my belief in a love that cannot be broken. Whether you find me in this lifetime or long after I am gone, know that I am here, cheering you on, supporting you, and loving you.</div><div><br></div><div>The world is waiting for you, and I have no doubt you will rise to meet its challenges. You are the heroine of this story, and I am proud to be the architect of the foundation that will help you succeed. But please, never leave me—now, or in the eternity that follows.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and eternal dedication,</div><div>Wendell</div>
