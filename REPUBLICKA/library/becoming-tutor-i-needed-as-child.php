<div class="library-tome-centered">
When I was growing up, there was something missing. I didn’t know it at the time, but what I needed was philosophy—a way to understand the world, to think deeply about my purpose, and to find meaning in life. It wasn’t until I was around twenty years old that I discovered philosophy, and by then, I felt like I had already lost precious time.<div><br></div><div>If I had been introduced to philosophy earlier, my life could have started so much sooner. I could have had the tools to shape my purpose, to figure out who I wanted to be, and to focus on what truly mattered. But instead, I wandered, unsure of how to navigate life’s questions.</div><div><br></div><div>So, I became the person I needed as a child. I became the greatest tutor I could imagine for myself. Through trial and error, I taught myself philosophy, and in doing so, I discovered not only my purpose but also a deep responsibility: to share this knowledge with others.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to give young people the opportunity I didn’t have. They shouldn’t have to wait until adulthood to explore the questions that define their lives. Philosophy teaches us how to think, how to question, and how to reflect—it’s a gift that should be given while minds are still growing and curious.</div><div><br></div><div>By introducing philosophy early, we can help young people find their mission sooner. Whether they dream of becoming content creators, artists, scientists, or something else entirely, philosophy can guide them toward their purpose and help them focus on what’s truly important.</div><div><br></div><div>This is my responsibility, my mission. I can’t change the past, but I can help shape the future. I want to tutor young minds, to give them the tools to grow into thoughtful, purposeful adults who can navigate life with wisdom and confidence.</div><div><br></div><div>Philosophy changed my life. I believe it can change theirs, too.</div><div><br></div><div>Respectfully,</div><div>Wendell</div>
