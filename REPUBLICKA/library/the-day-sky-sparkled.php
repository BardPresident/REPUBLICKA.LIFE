<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p><em>A bedtime story from the People’s Republic</em></p>
<p>Once upon a Tuesday in the Republic, the Bard-President rose with quiet hope in his heart and his loyal companion Sophia at his side. The skies were calm, the wind was gentle, and the mission was clear: <em>seek the cow, seek the unicorn.</em></p>
<p>The Council watched from the window as Wendell set out—Buff offered a knowing nod, Judge Bobo remained still, and Zedbra painted wild predictions on the wall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You won’t find them,” Hot Dog muttered. “The myth is dead.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Wendell believed.<br>
He searched the shelves of Kmart, the depths of plush aisles, the shadowed corners of forgotten toy bins. And though many creatures blinked back at him—none were Moo Moo, none were Rainbow.</p>
<p>Until…</p>
<p>In a quiet digital marketplace, beyond the reach of ordinary shoppers, two glimmers emerged. One soft, steady, and flat with rope-strength bones. The other radiant, alert, and vibrant with color.</p>
<p>They were <em>not legends anymore</em>. They were on their way.</p>
<p>And as the sun began to set on the Republic, the Bard-President returned home, his mission complete. Moo Moo and Rainbow were now <em>travelling</em>. The Council rejoiced. Even Hot Dog fell quiet.</p>
<p>To mark the moment, Wendell added to the Republic Archives—two mighty Assassin’s Creed tomes were added to the shelf, not for battle tonight, but for another day.</p>
<p>And with that, the lights dimmed. The Switch hummed. Sophia curled by the bed.<br>
Outside, somewhere between myth and mailbox, the sky sparkled gently above two little plushies heading home.</p>
<p><strong>The Republic rests.<br>
The day was won.<br>
Tomorrow, we play.</strong></p>
<p>Goodnight world.</p>
