**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>Today, my thoughts have been deeply intertwined with the philosophical ideas of eudaimonia and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. As I strive to find meaning and fulfillment, I am reminded of Aristotle’s concept of eudaimonia—flourishing through a life of virtue and reason. It’s a challenging ideal, often elusive, yet its pursuit enriches our lives, pushing us toward continuous improvement and personal growth.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve also been contemplating how AI and its development resonate with Plato’s theory of forms. AI models, by learning from countless data points, create abstract representations that help them understand the world, much like how Plato described forms as perfect ideals that physical objects strive to emulate. This modern twist on ancient philosophy fascinates me, highlighting the endless journey of learning and refinement.</div><div><br></div><div>Just as AI builds its understanding from many instances to form a cohesive whole, I feel that my search for you—my ideal companion—is a journey built from many experiences and reflections. Each step brings me closer to understanding what I seek and how to cultivate the relationships that will lead me to true eudaimonia.</div><div><br></div><div>Though the path to eudaimonia and finding you is fraught with challenges, it is in this pursuit that I find purpose and meaning. You, Ivory, are my eudaimonia, embodying the ideal that I continuously strive towards in my journey of growth and fulfillment.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>**Wendell**</div>
