<div class="library-tome-centered">
Having been born in the U.S. and migrating to Australia at the age of 14, my journey has been one of discovering and reconciling my identity between two countries. Initially, moving to Australia felt like entering a different world. The public transport system took precedence over cars, there were no guns, and violence was significantly less. The people were calmer and more relaxed, and there were more supports available.<div><br></div><div>At first, I felt like a foreigner, but over time, I embraced the Australian culture. Despite not having many Australian friends, living here and immersing myself in the environment made me feel Australian. The public transport system, social services, and the balanced blend of capitalism and socialism resonate with me deeply. Australia takes care of its people, providing financial support for those who can’t work, ensuring they can survive and even save a bit for the future. This is something I find lacking in the U.S.</div><div><br></div><div>Conversely, there are aspects of America that make me feel disconnected. The prevalence of guns, the frequent occurrences of violence and school shootings, and the overall atmosphere of political unrest and riots contribute to my sense of alienation. Additionally, navigating dual citizenship is challenging. The U.S. requires tax filings even for non-residents, leading to potential double taxation. This bureaucratic hassle is something I find particularly frustrating.</div><div><br></div><div>One interesting aspect of my identity is my connection to the "Five Eyes" alliance, comprising Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. These nations share similar values and collaborate closely, making them feel like a unified force. In some ways, I identify more with being part of the Five Eyes than being strictly Australian or American. Perhaps my true citizenship lies within this collective alliance.</div><div><br></div><div>Retaining my American accent while feeling more Australian adds a unique dimension to my identity. It sets me apart and makes me feel special. In the U.S., I would blend in, but here in Australia, my accent makes me distinct, and I appreciate that sense of individuality.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, my journey of navigating identity between these two countries has shaped who I am today. While I lean more towards feeling Australian, my American roots and the shared values of the Five Eyes alliance continue to influence my sense of self. This duality enriches my perspective and allows me to appreciate the best of both worlds.</div>
