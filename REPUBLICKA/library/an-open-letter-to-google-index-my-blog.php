<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>To the Google Team,</div><div><br></div><div>I am writing to you as a candidate for Prime Minister of Australia under the Emergence Party, and I am facing a major issue that goes beyond personal frustration—my campaign blog is not being indexed by Google, and there is no way to communicate directly with your company about this.</div><div><br></div><div>This is more than just a technical problem—it is election interference. If an independent political candidate cannot have their campaign content indexed by the largest search engine in the world, how are voters supposed to find their message?</div><div><br></div><div>The Problem: A Broken System of Communication</div><div><br></div><div>I have followed all proper indexing procedures, yet my blog remains invisible in Google Search. When I seek help, I am met with:</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 No human contact. Google provides no direct line of communication for independent creators and politicians trying to resolve indexing issues.</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 No transparency. There is no explanation as to why my campaign content is not appearing in search results.</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 A monopoly on political visibility. Google controls access to information, yet independent candidates like myself are unable to get our message seen while mainstream parties dominate search results.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not just frustrating—it is undemocratic. If Google’s systems prevent independent political candidates from reaching voters, then Google is actively interfering in elections by limiting public access to alternative perspectives.</div><div><br></div><div>Google’s Responsibility in a Democracy</div><div><br></div><div>Google is the largest gateway to information in the world, and that comes with a responsibility to ensure fair and unbiased access to content, especially during elections.</div><div><br></div><div>In Australia, voting is compulsory—every Australian must participate in elections whether they feel informed or not. If Google decides whose political content is visible and whose is not, then Google is deciding who gets a fair chance in democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>I am calling on Google to:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Index my blog immediately—so that voters can find my policies and campaign materials.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Provide a transparent explanation for why political content from independent candidates is not being indexed.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. Create direct communication channels for political candidates facing indexing issues, rather than forcing them into automated systems with no resolution.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. Ensure equal access to search visibility for all political voices, not just mainstream parties.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Search Should Serve the People—Not Control Them</div><div><br></div><div>If Google truly believes in free speech, democracy, and fair elections, then it must stop suppressing independent political content and allow my blog to be indexed immediately.</div><div><br></div><div>Silence and inaction are not acceptable. Google must take responsibility for its role in shaping democratic discourse.</div><div><br></div><div>The people deserve to hear all voices—not just the ones that algorithms decide are worthy.</div><div><br></div><div>Sincerely,</div><div>Wendell</div><div>Candidate for Prime Minister of Australia</div><div>Emergence Party</div><div>🔗 wendellsdiary.com</div>
