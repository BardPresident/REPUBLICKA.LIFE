<p><em>Wendell’s Bedtime Story – May 4, 2025</em></p>
<p>The stars were out, and the courtroom was quiet. Judge Bobo was deep in thought, his tiny paws resting on a mountain of evidence. Somewhere in the stillness of the Republic, Sophia let out a tired sigh—mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Today had been a day of <em>completion</em>.</p>
<p>The book—<strong>The Stolen Election</strong>—was written.<br>
The court had been addressed.<br>
And the truth, long ignored, had finally been placed on record.</p>
<p>No more begging for attention.<br>
No more asking for a seat at their table.</p>
<p>The Republic had its own table now. Handmade. Plush-guarded. Flag-waving.</p>
<p>And as if the universe itself applauded, a little magic came from beyond the walls of the Republic—a pre-order for the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> was secured. Joy, play, and multiplayer dreams now had a date of arrival. Even the merchants of this realm now knew the President by name.</p>
<p>And in that peace, Wendell smiled.</p>
<p>The campaign was over. The foundation laid. The bard could rest—not to stop, but to begin anew. Now begins the motion. The building. The <em>living</em> of what had once been dreamt.</p>
<p>The Republic was no longer an idea.</p>
<p><strong>It was home.</strong></p>
<p>And as Wendell closed his eyes, with Sophia curled at his side, the stars whispered above the walls of the plush council chamber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The hard part is over, bard.<br>
Now, let it flourish.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goodnight, Republic.<br>
We are real.</p>
<p>—The End—</p>
