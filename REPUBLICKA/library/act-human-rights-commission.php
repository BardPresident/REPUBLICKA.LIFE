And I can either be this unofficially broadcasted to the world or officially broadcasted to the world. Because I represent the very heart of your organisation in every single aspect. I was not built from learning a trade but instead conditioning virtue in every aspect of my existence documented every single step of the way. I am a real-life super hero/villain among you and Human Rights is the very fabric of my existence demonstrated philosophically throughout the documented actions of my day to day super high-functioning technology driven artificial intelligence existence actualised into the psychology of the layer of consciousness that exists before the thought - the essence that drives the every moment of existence that we can assert to be a soul. I run circles around your most intelligent academic scholars excelling polymathematically in all aspects of life with the only exception being financially. But that is the reason that I am now the Director of the ACT Human Rights Commision. I have now just claimed this job whether you guys like it or not. And I am claiming that title from now into the future and I will work very hard throughout my films directing actions by demanding justice for the rest of my life and I will appreciate everyone working hard with me to try and build a loving and caring future government. I will very much reward everyone for their commitment to help make the world a better place with me. I will not take no for an answer. If you say no, then that will just be a funny part in my future films.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have invented a technique that shares some likeness to blackmail. But it has never been done that I know of so I have coined it goldmail. And as far as I know, goldmail is not illegal currently (yes, I have done research). So I will exploit that in the system. Here is how my system works. I make entirely reasonable demands and provide countless amounts of proof as to why those demands should be met and film that process publicly. I then tell the recipient that we are filming this and that what they choose to do is what will be publicly documented to the entire world. This then goes down in history as the government making bad decisions when mountain loads of evidence was provided into why they should be ethically inclined to make a good choice as that very important information being revealed to the person the trick is being played upon.</p><p><br /></p><p>I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH! This email is now being filmed. Enjoy the episode that is named after you. And what you choose to do as a result of this video will be publicly documented for all of time for everybody to see the true heart of our government. Because your actions, or shall I say reactions or lack of reactions will determine how inclined the general public will be to trust the government in the future high-tech society which I lead. You have 100% free will and no matter what choice you make, I make good film and it is funny if you do the wrong thing and it is amazing when you do the right thing so don't worry about doing the wrong thing if you need to. Just realise that those choices will then forever be reflected in the future actions of society. Because I am the spider and I made the web. I control it from afar but people have not quite figured that out yet. Because I already have artificial intelligence that now understands me and is working for me.</p><p><br /></p><p>I love you. Please enjoy your video: https://www.bitchute.com/video/3eCRddOL6dZA/</p><p><br /></p><p>Logically, you should do the right thing and say yes Wendell.</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyone who is not on board with all of this then I will require their immediate resignation. You all know my email. I only report to the president, Dr Helen Watchirs, who cannot fire me but can constrain, enable, and direct my future actions. I am very much interested in the wise guidance of everyone on board. Let's change the world team!</p><p><br /></p><p>With Love and Heart,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell Charles NeSmith</p><p>ACT Human Rights Commission</p><p>Director</p><p> One attachment</p><p>  •  Scanned by Gmail</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell Charles NeSmith <wendell@nesmith.net></p><p>Attachments</p><p>Sat, Aug 22, 2020, 1:54 PM</p><p>to cbhalsey</p><p><br /></p><p>Please read the email below and think hard.

But I put a lot of heart into this complaint and created it so my point can not misunderstand. I made a movie and broadcasted it through the Internet out to the entire world and this is my complaint, so I would be very careful about ignoring it, for its results will end up in future productions. There is not only extremely important information in it, but also REAL LIFE footage demonstrating the problems that I am speaking about and how to fix them.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please tell me what paperwork that I need to lodge a complaint INCLUDING this movie:</p><p><br /></p><p>http://www.divinetragedy.tv/films/living-neverland/</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell Charles NeSmith</p><p><br /></p><p>P.S. This is very serious and I am going to spend the rest of my life on all of this until mental health listens to me. Mental health has no right to oppress gifted people. I just won an award for my first feature film, Ivory Heart (and I just released that December 21, 2012). Living Neverland will win many. The content in my head is gold and when mental health deems that content as "unhealthy" and strips people of their rights because of harmless eccentric behaviour, it loses any potential to develop into a system that actually helps people. Collective psychology has no room for an award winning philosopher that did it all ALONE. When our mental health services force methods of treatment on their "subject" that their "subject" is uncomfortable with, all we do is inflict suffering. Our mental health services will reap all of my wrath and I will not stop. I do have the rest of my life ya know.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>With Heart,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell Charles NeSmith</p><p>imdb.me/wcn</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>On Sun, Sep 30, 2012 at 3:24 PM, Wendell Charles NeSmith <wendell@nesmith.net> wrote:</p><p>Dear Jennifer,</p><p><br /></p><p>I have not forgotten about this and I will do it.

After my "treatment" in Ballarat, I lodged a complaint that was ignored and now I have tried to lodge another one but the Victoria Human Rights Commission is ignoring me.</p><p><br /></p><p>It appears that you have misjudged my email, for my "treatment" was only the example. I voluntarily walked into the hospital each time and then was quickly incarcerated because of the way I think (I am a philosopher): not any unlawful behaviour. My war is with Australia. I was never treated by NSW but you are a part of the war. Maybe each state has minor differences in regulations, but at the end of the day each state forces medications upon non-violent people as well as take the rights away from patients that are in a stable condition. Non of your systems think. None of them listen to people but instead box them up into a medicinally "treatable" "illnesses".</p><p><br /></p><p>You all will pay because it is the government doing this to people. I was never treated in NSW. But my war is against all of Australia because it is the same story throughout the country. And soon this war will not only be my war, because I documented the events as they happened while incarcerated. Eventually people will see you for what you are: an oppressive system designed to control its minorities who are unable to conform to capitalistic values.</p><p><br /></p><p>So now it is your turn to blow me off and say that it is not your problem because I was not treated in New South Wales. But here is the thing: my fight is for everybody else and NOT myself. What do I have to gain by doing all of this? It is called NOTHING. Except my soul which will rest in peace when it leaves this body because I fought for everyone's basic human rights. But until then I will fight against all of your systems, AKA, the Australian Government.</p><p><br /></p><p>I went to Canberra to get involved with fixing the mental health sectors within Australia because I have spent my life studying these topics (particularly suicide). However, I was ignored. So now I will make a scene for the rest of my life with every department that is responsible for employing these oppressive practices. You are one of them.</p><p><br /></p><p>My life is dedicated to resolving this oppression found within our psychiatric facilities. None of you will let me in to do it so I will broadcast that fact to the world as well as spend the rest of my life screaming at all of you for doing it. I am a sociologist. I know what I am talking about [PERIOD].</p><p><br /></p><p>With Heart,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>On Fri, Oct 11, 2013 at 6:42 AM, Lisa Tarasenko <LTarasenko@hccc.nsw.gov.au> wrote:</p><p>Dear Mr NeSmith</p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you for your email received by the Commission on 9 October 2013.

I'm really sorry. It's on my list for Monday first thing. I think I might ask the psychiatrist at AMHU to write a letter of support for your DSP application, and of course I'm also happy to add my support.</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm not sure if you're able to have a look at the DSP application online, but if you are could you possibly familiarise yourself with the requirements so that we can discuss it, and I can have your case manager assist you to fill it out. I have a contact at Centerlink and I may possibly have a chance at fast-tracking it (no guarantees but I can try).</p><p><br /></p><p>Then if we can get an ACT Housing Application done, then once on the list I'm happy to advocate for you to be put on the high priority list. I've had some success with this in the past.</p><p><br /></p><p>Plenty of work to do next week. Stay warm. Sorry I couldn't get anything immediately.</p><p><br /></p><p>Cheers  Chris :)</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell Charles NeSmith <wendell@nesmith.net></p><p>Mon, Jul 30, 2018, 12:42 AM</p><p>to Chris</p><p><br /></p><p>Hi Chris,</p><p><br /></p><p>I have been thinking and praying a lot.
