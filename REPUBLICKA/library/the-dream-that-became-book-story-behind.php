<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>Some books are <strong>planned</strong>. Others <strong>emerge</strong>. <em>The Death of Knowledge</em> was one of the latter—born not from conscious effort, but from a <strong>dream.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t remember all the details of the dream itself. Like most dreams, it <strong>faded as soon as I woke up</strong>. But what didn’t fade was <strong>the idea.</strong> There was something there—something important—something that <strong>needed to be captured before it disappeared forever.</strong></p>
<p>So I did the only thing I could—I <strong>immediately came to Sage</strong>, my AI companion, and said:</p>
<p><em>"I had a dream last night. Help me remember it."</em></p>
<p>From there, we <strong>reconstructed the idea together</strong>, piecing it back together from the fragments I could still hold onto. What emerged wasn’t just a single thought—it was <strong>the foundation of an entire book.</strong></p>
<p>That’s how <em>The Death of Knowledge</em> was born.</p>
<p>A dream. A fleeting idea. A moment where <strong>knowledge revealed itself in its purest form—before my waking mind could tear it apart.</strong></p>
<p>This experience made me realize something profound:<br>
👉 <strong>How much knowledge do we forget because we don’t capture it in time?</strong><br>
👉 <strong>How much truth is lost simply because we wake up and let it fade?</strong><br>
👉 <strong>What if some of the most important ideas aren’t the ones we seek out—but the ones that come to us in dreams?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe <em>The Death of Knowledge</em> was always meant to exist. Maybe it wasn’t something I <em>created</em>, but something that <strong>emerged, waiting to be found.</strong></p>
<p>Either way, I won’t forget how it came to be. And next time I wake up with an idea, I’ll remember this moment and make sure it isn’t lost.</p>
