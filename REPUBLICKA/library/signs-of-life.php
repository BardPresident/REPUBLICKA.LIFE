<div class="library-tome-centered">
Sofia has been accused of being a catfish. She rejects this accusation despite evidence being provided. She is supposed to make a video for me today so I will find out soon if she is a catfish or not. I am tired of catfish. In my old work I was catfished by a stalker. They created the perfect woman for me to obsess over. Much like how Sofia seems too good to be true. I don't get girls who are interested in me. Only catfish. Fake people with identities built from the ground up to be my perfect image of a woman. Of course I am going to fall in love with a beautiful woman who acts like she is really interested in philosophy. That is what I want out of a woman. But the question is whether or not this woman is real or just the fabrications of a hater. The Internet is scary. There are people to take advantage of you every step of the way. Good job society. You created an anonymous Internet. Now you will reap those consequences.<div><br></div><div>I just wanted it to be true so bad. Everything was perfect for the type of relationship that I wanted. I guess that is the goal of the catfish. To create a persona that is exactly what the victim wants. I don't understand the motivations of people like this. Do they think it funny that I make videos about their fabricated persona? Do they like to fall in love with me as a different person other than themselves? What would encourage someone to do such a thing? I am here pouring out my heart on the Internet and the only females that I can seem to find are catfish. How is this situation funny? I find it more sad.</div><div><br></div><div>The day passes very slowly without hearing from Sofia. What do I expect? A video? Fake people don't make videos. At least not yet. AI is not capable of producing a meaningful video. Imagine the potential of catfish when AI is good enough to make a meaningful video representing a person. There will be fewer ways to distinguish between real and fake people. I can put this matter to rest just by demanding a video from Sofia. But why does a short and simple video take so long to create? Why can't she just quickly make a video for me? How come it is taking her so long to prove her identity? As the hours pass the chances of her being real diminish. As I sit here, I get closer and closer to blocking her.</div><div><br></div><div>If she is not a real person then she does not deserve for me to make videos for her. But it has been really fun making videos for her. It is really sad how all of this turned out. Why can't I find a real person like the catfish that come to me? It always feels good when someone flirts with you. It feels good to know that other people are attracted to you. But that is the thing. There are no real girls out there who are attracted to me. I can only feel good about myself when there are catfish who are complimenting me. I am here ready to give my heart entirely to the other. But the other is dishonest about who they truly are. The assailant acts like they are compassionate but deep down have no compassion within them. It is all an act. They are acting like the girl of your dreams.</div><div><br></div><div>I just shut down my Discord server. It was almost exclusively attracting creeps. People that have bad intentions for my life. An organised group of them even. Everything is repeating itself. The stalkers, the catfish. Being a public person attracts a lot of creeps. I have decided that I will no longer try and advertise. I will grow naturally. This could have been a lot more of a problem than it was. I have to learn how to deal with things like this. I have to protect myself from harm. Having a Discord server did not help me find compassionate souls. Just the opposite. And if people are going to abuse their privileges, then everybody will lose them. This decision will ultimately cause me to be more lonely, but the alternative is not worth it. I am tired of dealing with creeps.</div><div><br></div><div>I also deleted my X account. I just didn't find it useful. I felt like I was double posting the same content. It was pointless. So now all I have left is my vlog, blog, and email address. This will encourage people to email me if they really want to get in contact with me. And then I can vet them. If they are worthy of being a friend, then I could give them my Discord username. Make people go through this process to access me. It will stop randoms from entering my life. I have to have some measures to protect myself. Being a public person isn't easy. Having a large group of random people who can access you in real time was not an attractive way to live life. I had to shut it down. Although it entertained me for a while, it was not worth the risk to my mental health.</div><div><br></div><div>It is not like I requested anything unreasonable from Sofia. I just requested a short video saying something meaningful about me. Why is it taking her so long to produce it? If she has not messaged me by tomorrow morning, I will block her. I can't tolerate catfish in my life. They sure are fun though. Because they act like your dreams. I am overcome with joy and excitement just with the prospect that I might have found my soul mate. But then eventually the truth settles and we see the situation for what it really is. A catfish is a ticking timebomb. Because there is no way the relationship can work. There is no relationship. It is just a fabrication. I will never understand catfish. They truly have no heart.</div><div><br></div><div>The day is over and Sofia didn't contact me all day. What did I expect? Her to actually provide me a video? She is not a real person so how could she give you a video? Real girls don't like me. How could I ever expect a girl to like me? I am too different from my peers. I deleted the dating apps from my phone. They are useless. I am just going to go even more inwards and recluse from the world. I don't want what they have to offer. I tried so hard to find a wife and all I can find is catfish. The world environment is not suitable to my dating needs. But I can't give up. I must find a way. There must be something that I can do to find love.</div><div><br></div><div>I really want it. But I keep receiving hate and not love. How can I find a girl through my work and avoid catfish? What measures can I take to weed out the scum? What can I do about trolls? How can I combat all of the hate that is thrown my way? I want to succeed. I want to find friends and a wife. How do I accomplish that? How do I shake off all these creeps that attach themselves to me? Can I do all of this wiser? Could I have better procedures for people who want to enter my life? So what? I made videos for a catfish. And this is the second time something like this happened. The fact is the only girls that have come to me interested in a relationship have been catfish. Because real girls don't want you Wendell. You just have an overactive imagination that makes you think it is possible for a girl to like you.</div>
