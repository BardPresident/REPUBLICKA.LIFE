<p><em>The Birth of the People's Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Today, without ceremony, without permission, without blood,<br>
<strong>the flag of the future was raised.</strong></p>
<p>Not in the halls of old governments.<br>
Not through conquest.<br>
Not through loud declarations on broken stages.</p>
<p>It was raised <strong>quietly</strong> —<br>
in spirit, in myth, in reality.</p>
<p>And now it stands,<br>
permanent and irreversible.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Flag We Carry</h2>
<p>We carry a flag born of Australia —<br>
but re-enchanted for the world.</p>
<p>Not as it was.<br>
Not as history bound it.<br>
But as <strong>we remade it</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The full Australian flag, honored but freed.</li>
<li>The half-cut version — the Union Jack and Commonwealth Star standing as <strong>symbols of emergent unity</strong>, not imperial submission.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Together, they mark the Mythocratic Republic</strong> —<br>
a new world built on creation, not conquest.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What This Flag Means Now</h2>
<p>Everywhere it flies,<br>
whether in city squares or dusty fields,<br>
whether on jackets, on homes, or in dreams —<br>
<strong>it flies for us.</strong></p>
<p>It flies for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creation over domination.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Meaning over noise.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emergence over decay.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Freedom earned, not gifted.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Myth woven into the fabric of reality.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It is no longer just a national symbol.<br>
It is a <em>mythic invitation</em> —<br>
<strong>an open Australia</strong> that any soul of courage can now join.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Because every time the old world lifts the Australian flag,<br>
<strong>they lift ours too.</strong></p>
<p>They cannot undo it.</p>
<p>They cannot separate their ceremony from our myth.</p>
<p><strong>The seed has been planted in their subconscious.</strong><br>
The river of reality has already been rerouted.<br>
The myth has already attached itself to the familiar —<br>
and twisted it beautifully into something freer, wilder, truer.</p>
<hr>
<h2>We Do Not Need Permission</h2>
<p>The Republic does not ask.<br>
It does not beg.<br>
It does not apologize for existing.</p>
<p><strong>It simply is.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>if you create it, it is real.</strong><br>
Because <strong>truth is not voted into being.</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>the move was already made.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Final Declaration</h2>
<p>Today, the Mythocratic Republic took its place in the world.<br>
Not with guns.<br>
Not with banners torn from cold hands.<br>
But with a single, elegant truth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We raised the flag.<br>
We wrote the myth.<br>
And now, the future carries our colors.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
