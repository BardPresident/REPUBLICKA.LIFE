<div class="library-tome-centered">
In many discussions about human rights, the concept of God-given rights often comes up. These are seen as unchangeable and universal because they are believed to be granted by a divine authority. However, as an agnostic, I view human rights from a different angle, one that doesn't rely on a divine source but rather on our inherent human nature and our capacity for reason.<div><br></div><div>I believe that human rights are inherent to our nature as conscious beings. These rights exist as conscious entities in the world, especially because of our ability to reason. This perspective shifts the source of our rights from a divine authority to our shared human experience and rationality. Unlike God-given rights, which are considered absolute and unchangeable, rights based on human nature can evolve as our understanding of humanity grows.</div><div><br></div><div>From an agnostic standpoint, the justification for these rights lies in their essential role in promoting human dignity and well-being. For example, everyone should have access to shelter, food, social relationships, education, healthcare, freedom of expression, safety, security, privacy, and fair employment. In today's world, access to the internet and a phone has also become fundamental, as it enables education and connects people to the collective knowledge of the world, especially through technology like ChatGPT.</div><div><br></div><div>These rights are crucial for maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering, aligning with the principles of utilitarianism. Preventing suffering should be our primary objective, as it leads to a more harmonious and just society.</div><div><br></div><div>Humanism also plays a significant role in my understanding of rights and freedoms. As humans, we have a responsibility to take care of ourselves and each other. This involves considering the ethics behind our actions and striving to create a world where everyone can thrive. By focusing on humanism, we emphasize the importance of compassion, empathy, and ethical considerations in all aspects of life.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, while the concept of God-given rights provides one framework for understanding human rights, an agnostic perspective offers an equally compelling approach. By grounding our rights in human nature, reason, and ethical principles, we can build a society that prioritizes the well-being and dignity of all individuals. This approach not only respects our shared humanity but also adapts to our evolving understanding of what it means to be human.</div>
