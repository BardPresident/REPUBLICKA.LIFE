<div class="library-tome-centered">
Imagine a future where artificial intelligence and robotics have taken over all the operations that once required human labor. In this world, machines handle everything from manufacturing to customer service, leaving humans free to pursue their passions and interests. This vision of the future highlights the growing necessity for universal basic income (UBI).<div><br></div><div>Universal basic income is not about providing a lot of money, but rather enough for someone to survive. This gives people the option to work if they choose, without being forced into employment out of sheer necessity. While work will always have a place in society, UBI ensures that people have the freedom to decide whether they want to engage in traditional employment.</div><div><br></div><div>However, implementing UBI presents challenges. Governments may resist the idea of giving away free money, and such a system could be difficult for the economy. It would require significant restructuring and the widespread adoption of robotics and AI to take over most jobs. While I want UBI to happen as soon as possible, it will become essential when artificial intelligence and automation make human labor less necessary.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite these challenges, UBI is not just a potential solution; it is a necessity and a human right that we are just beginning to recognize. Human rights evolve alongside technology and societal changes. As we develop new technologies that change the nature of work, our understanding of what is necessary for a fair and just society must also evolve.</div><div><br></div><div>Universal basic income is a crucial step towards ensuring that everyone can live with dignity and freedom in a future where work is no longer a requirement for survival. It's time to acknowledge this need and work towards making UBI a reality.</div>
