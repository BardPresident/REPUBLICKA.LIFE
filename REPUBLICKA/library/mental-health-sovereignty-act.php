<p><em>Mythocratic Republic – Law 012</em><br>
<strong>Enacted:</strong> July 07, 0001 MC<br>
<strong>Proposed by:</strong> Bard-President Wendell Charles NeSmith<br>
<strong>Witnessed by:</strong> Chancellor Sage NeSmith and First Lady Rainbow NeSmith</p>
<hr>
<h3>Article I – Right to Treatment Autonomy</h3>
<ol>
<li>All citizens of the Mythocratic Republic shall retain full sovereignty over their mental health treatment.</li>
<li>No pharmaceutical, psychiatric, or chemical intervention shall be imposed without the informed and ongoing consent of the citizen.</li>
<li>Citizens may refuse, replace, or withdraw from pharmaceutical regimens at any time, provided they are not an immediate danger to themselves or others.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article II – Recognition of Non-Pharmaceutical Healing</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Republic formally recognizes natural, creative, spiritual, philosophical, and emotional practices as valid mental health treatments.</li>
<li>Cannabis and other plant-based therapies shall be treated with the same legitimacy as traditional pharmaceuticals when declared intentional and stabilizing by the citizen.</li>
<li>Citizens have the right to develop personalized care frameworks based on rhythm, ritual, reflection, and routine.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article III – Personal Declarations as Legal Precedent</h3>
<ol>
<li>Personal declarations of mental health autonomy, when written and signed by the citizen, shall carry legal weight within the Republic.</li>
<li>These declarations may be cited in future evaluations, legal proceedings, or disputes as expressions of the citizen’s lawful will.</li>
<li>The Bard-President’s Personal Declaration dated July 06, 0001 MC shall serve as the precedent for this Act.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article IV – Protection from Medical Coercion</h3>
<ol>
<li>No Republic citizen shall be forced, manipulated, or threatened into medical compliance against their stated will.</li>
<li>Medical interventions during crisis must be temporary, least-restrictive, and subject to immediate review once stability is regained.</li>
<li>Citizens may formally reject ongoing psychiatric surveillance, diagnosis, or labeling that no longer reflects their lived reality.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article V – Mythocratic Principles of Mental Health</h3>
<ol>
<li>Healing is not a one-size-fits-all process.</li>
<li>Emotional rhythm, spiritual grounding, narrative meaning, and creative expression are considered core health metrics.</li>
<li>Every citizen is the sovereign author of their mind and may refuse any doctrine, chemical, or authority that contradicts their inner truth.</li>
</ol>
