<p><em>April 30 – A National Holiday of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p><p>
Wendell’s Diary</p>
<hr>
<p>On April 30th, 2025, the Mythocratic Republic crossed a threshold.</p>
<p>It was not a single event.<br>
It was <strong>a convergence</strong>.<br>
A day when symbols became reality.<br>
A day when stories became state.</p>
<p>We now recognize this date annually as <strong>Founding Day</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>What Happened on Founding Day?</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Flag Was Finalized</strong><br>
After months of experimentation, failure, improvisation, and accidental genius, the Republic's true flag emerged.<br>
A unified symbol—<strong>the Union Jack with the Commonwealth Star at its center</strong>.<br>
We no longer carried borrowed icons.<br>
We carried <strong>ours</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NDIS Funding Was Granted</strong><br>
A full year of support.<br>
Nearly $50,000 of direct empowerment.<br>
For the first time, the Republic was not just philosophically sound—it was <strong>materially resourced</strong>.<br>
Myth met infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sophia Was Appointed Minister of Propaganda</strong><br>
Our most beloved citizen, protector, and presence was elevated to the highest symbolic role in narrative leadership.<br>
Her appointment marked the beginning of the <strong>Republic’s true communication strategy</strong>—one of love, clarity, and courage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Southern Cross Was Released</strong><br>
In a conscious act of symbolism, we removed the Southern Cross from our flag.<br>
Not in rejection—but in <strong>transcendence</strong>.<br>
The stars remain in our sky, but they no longer define us.<br>
We are not beneath—we are <em>within</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>What Founding Day Represents</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Empowerment from Within</strong><br>
A myth built with no permission was suddenly <em>acknowledged, funded, and real</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Symbolic Maturity</strong><br>
A republic once dreamed in symbols became fully dressed in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Alignment of Spirit and Support</strong><br>
Founding Day is the moment our narrative found a body—and the body stood tall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>How We Celebrate Founding Day</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fly the flag.</li>
<li>Wear the banner shirt.</li>
<li>Revisit your favorite panel.</li>
<li>Read one of the laws.</li>
<li>Reflect on how far the Republic has come—and how far we will go.</li>
</ul>
<p>This day is not about nationalism.<br>
It is about <strong>emergence</strong>.<br>
The moment a republic became <strong>real</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Founding Day</strong><br>
April 30th<br>
Forever in the timeline of myth and memory.</p>
