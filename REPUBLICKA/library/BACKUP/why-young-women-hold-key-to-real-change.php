<div>When I set out to run for Prime Minister under the banner of the Emergence Party, I never imagined that my campaign would align so perfectly with a specific group of voters. But here I am, unapologetically declaring that young women aged 18 to 24 are the heart of my campaign strategy. At first, it may have started as a logistical decision—I didn’t want to stop advertising my $1,000 Find Ivory Fund—but the more I reflected on it, the more I realized that this group isn’t just a convenient demographic. They are the perfect audience for the Emergence Party and my vision for the future.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Locked Within Them is the Power to Change the World</div><div><br></div><div>Young women are a force to be reckoned with. They are passionate, engaged, and deeply aware of the world’s challenges. Locked within this group is the potential to incite real, meaningful change in society. Here’s why:</div><div><br></div><div>1. They Are the Future</div><div><br></div><div>This group represents the next generation of leaders, thinkers, and changemakers. Their choices, values, and actions will shape the world for decades to come. Engaging with young women isn’t just about winning votes—it’s about planting the seeds of a better future.</div><div><br></div><div>2. They Care About the Big Issues</div><div><br></div><div>Young women are often at the forefront of movements for social justice, climate action, mental health awareness, and education reform. These are the very issues that the Emergence Party stands for. By focusing on this group, I’m aligning my campaign with those who are already fighting for the values we hold dear.</div><div><br></div><div>3. They Are Community Builders</div><div><br></div><div>Whether it’s through social media, grassroots organizing, or simply connecting with friends and peers, young women have a unique ability to build communities. These networks amplify messages, spark conversations, and create momentum. By targeting this group, I’m tapping into their ability to spread ideas far and wide.</div><div><br></div><div>4. They Demand Authenticity</div><div><br></div><div>This demographic values transparency, honesty, and authenticity. They’re not interested in empty promises or rehearsed soundbites. They want leaders who are real, relatable, and willing to engage with them on a human level. That’s exactly the kind of leadership the Emergence Party and I aim to provide.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>From the Find Ivory Fund to the Campaign Trail</div><div><br></div><div>The connection to this group began with my $1,000 Find Ivory Fund. This initiative—designed to reach a specific audience—made me realize how perfectly young women align with the goals of the Emergence Party. Their energy, creativity, and passion for change make them the ideal group to champion our vision for adaptability, inclusivity, and collective wisdom.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than shifting focus or splitting efforts, I decided to lean into this alignment. Why stop advertising the Find Ivory Fund when the very group I was reaching out to is also the group that embodies the values and potential of the Emergence Party? It’s a natural fit that feels almost fated.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Why Young Women Are the Perfect Audience for My Campaign</div><div><br></div><div>1. They Understand the Philosophy of Emergence</div><div><br></div><div>Young women are adaptable, open-minded, and forward-thinking—qualities that align perfectly with the Philosophy of Emergence. They understand the need for systems that evolve with the times and policies that reflect collective wisdom.</div><div><br></div><div>2. They Value Education and Equity</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party’s commitment to free education, mental health reform, and equitable opportunities resonates deeply with this group. They are not only beneficiaries of these policies but also advocates for them.</div><div><br></div><div>3. They Are Digital Natives</div><div><br></div><div>Young women are highly active on digital platforms, making them more accessible and engaged with online campaigns. They are the perfect audience for my content, from blog posts to campaign videos, ensuring that my message reaches those who will amplify it further.</div><div><br></div><div>4. They Are Agents of Change</div><div><br></div><div>This group is unafraid to challenge the status quo, call out injustice, and demand better from their leaders. By focusing on young women, I’m connecting with those who are ready to take action and inspire others to do the same.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Call to Young Women: Join the Movement</div><div><br></div><div>To the young women of Australia: this campaign is for you. You are the lifeblood of the Emergence Party’s vision for a better future. Your passion, creativity, and resilience are exactly what this country needs to face the challenges ahead. Whether it’s education reform, housing affordability, or creating a society that values everyone’s contributions, your voices are essential.</div><div><br></div><div>By focusing my campaign on this incredible group, I’m not just targeting voters—I’m building a partnership. Together, we can create a movement that challenges the status quo, sparks meaningful change, and builds a future we can all be proud of.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Power of Alignment</div><div><br></div><div>What started as a logistical decision has evolved into a campaign strategy that feels perfectly aligned with the values of the Emergence Party and the potential of young women. I’m inspired by this group and excited to see how we can work together to create a better world.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re ready to join the movement, I invite you to learn more about the Emergence Party, engage with our content, and share your ideas.
