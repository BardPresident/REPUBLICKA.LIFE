One’s time is directed towards increasing happiness</p><p>by seeking that which is loved. Unfortunately, the uninvited guest</p><p>named ‘suffering’ seems to present itself the closer that we get to reaching</p><p>this love. Are we merely captives to current conceptions of love? For love to</p><p>merely exist to encourage reproduction seems to discredit the importance of</p><p>this love. To label one’s love as an inevitable conflict between individuals</p><p>exposes love as hopeless. There appears to be something hidden in the very</p><p>concept of love that could stand as knowledge itself. But to access this</p><p>knowledge, must one necessarily suffer? It could stand to reason that</p><p>suffering is a result of the corruption of love and does not manifest from love</p><p>itself.</p><p><br /></p><p>Love’s Ideological Captivity</p><p>At birth, an infant is passed an ideological preconception of their</p><p>purpose. A cookie cutter that was also passed to the infants caretaker. A</p><p>purpose to find happiness through romantic love. Current culture hands</p><p>the cookie cutter to the infant and expects it to readily jump into the cutter’s</p><p>borders. The infant is expected to grow within that cookie cutter so that</p><p>eventually they can be what current culture expects it to be. If one decides</p><p>not to use that cookie cutter to mold their being, they become something not</p><p>understood. They become alienated by those whom are different from their</p><p>own culturally relative collective teachings.</p><p><br /></p><p>The present ideological cookie cutter within Western culture pressures</p><p>each individual to value romantic love as ultimate life purpose. One is held</p><p><br /></p><p>captive to a particular ideology of love. Romantic love is obsessed over,</p><p>which causes great anguish on the subjects psychology. For one to have</p><p>a ‘good’ life, one is expected to grow up, fall in love, have a family, work,</p><p>retire, and then die. How is one to react to this ideology of love? It appears</p><p>premature to assert that romantic love will achieve this happiness when</p><p>relationship after relationship struggles and falls apart in front of our eyes.</p><p>Culture’s notion of ‘love’ seems to cause its people great amounts of pain and</p><p>suffering. To say that romantic love can truly lead us to personal happiness</p><p>seems extremely rash when one can observe from the observations in their</p><p>own lives, countless unhealthy, miserable, and failed romantic partnerships.</p><p><br /></p><p>Defining an Abstract such as ‘Love’</p><p>To define romantic love, the haze of the abstraction must be cleared.</p><p>It seems to manifest in each individual and guide their entire lives. One is</p><p>led to investigate culture and what purpose it serves and why it is so highly</p><p>valued in our current society. The ability to achieve happiness appears to be</p><p>very closely tied to love. When we attempt to define this love, we tend to only</p><p>be able to define what it is not, which creates confusion by comparison. This</p><p>ultimately steers us away from our subjects real essence, which is and can</p><p>only be itself.</p><p><br /></p><p>According to Schopenhauer, one’s desire for romantic love is</p><p>heavily dependant on the human desire to reproduce for the greater good</p><p>of the species from an impersonal level. To reproduce is to continue one’s</p><p>existence. It is to continue ones own existence in and through another. He</p><p>asserts,</p><p><br /></p><p>“he will specially desire in the other individual those perfections that he himself</p><p><br /></p><p>lacks; in fact, he will even find beautiful those imperfections that are the opposite of</p><p>his own. Hence, for example, short men look for tall women, persons with fair hair</p><p>like those with dark, and so on. The delusive ecstasy that seizes a man at the sight of</p><p>a woman whose beauty is suited to him, and pictures to him a union with her as the</p><p>highest good, is just the sense of the species.” Schopenhauer continues, “Therefore,</p><p>what here guides man is really an instinct directed to what is best for the species,</p><p>whereas man himself imagines he is seeking merely a heightening of his own</p><p><br /></p><p>pleasure.”</p><p>1</p><p><br /></p><p>From this heteronormative perspective, one can understand romantic</p><p>love to exist like a magic trick presented to the audience. Each individual is</p><p>asked, “Is this your card?”, and the responses are, “Wow, yes!”. However, the</p><p>factual trick is that all of the cards are the same. One believes this magic trick</p><p>to be performed specific to their own individual selves, when in actual fact,</p><p>they are simply the subjects of nature’s own agenda: to sexually reproduce to</p><p>improve the genetic gene pool of future generations.</p><p><br /></p><p>The accuracy of this depiction does not account for many types of</p><p>relationships. Homosexual, asexual, virus infected, and infertile relationships</p><p>present an innate flaw in Schopenhauer’s conclusion. In current society, one</p><p>does not always seek what one lacks within the other, and one might seek</p><p>similarities rather than genetic development. Short people might seek short</p><p>people, and tall people might seek tall people. It could stand to reason that</p><p>Schopenhauer’s depiction was composed of his own cultural cookie cutter,</p><p>that encouraged a cleaner genetic pool.</p><p><br /></p><p>We are left with something hidden that is difficult to pinpoint or even</p><p>articulate. The cookie cutter has given the mold, but not explained the reason</p><p>why this particular mold should be utilized instead of another.</p><p><br /></p><p>1Arthur Schopenhauer, The World As Will and Representation (New York: Dover, 1958), 539</p><p><br /></p><p>The Experiment</p><p>Upon commencing my investigations into this topic, I was asked by a</p><p>co-worker, “What? You don’t already understand what love is?” I responded</p><p>with, “No, do you?” He brushed me off pridefully stating, “You must be</p><p>stupid.” I questioned him seeking his declared wisdom asking, “What do you</p><p>know love to be?” His initial reply consisted of multiple linguistic filler words,</p><p>followed with, “I can’t believe that you don’t know what love is.”</p><p><br /></p><p>The more I learn about this topic, the more I understand its unchecked</p><p>ramifications. Just as Aristotle teaches one to practically integrate wisdom</p><p>from thoughts into actions</p><p>2</p><p>, my mission became to find out how others around</p><p>me understood and interpreted this subject. It was at this point I commenced</p><p>an experiment. One individual after another I sat down with, in attempts to</p><p>extract a more competent understanding of my current cultures understanding</p><p>of love, asking the popular but seemingly unanswered question, “What is</p><p>love?”</p><p><br /></p><p>I asked this question to a large number of age groups, sexual</p><p>orientations, and statuses. I spoke with over thirty individuals. In every case,</p><p>the trend of hesitance and surprise carried on from the original subject. I was</p><p>able to extract little to no information from a single person. Most concluded</p><p>that I was mentally inept for asking such an ‘obvious’ question. From one</p><p>perspective, the experiment was a failure. But was it really? This tells me that</p><p>there is definitely something hiding in love. Something that others feel more</p><p>comfortable to act within instead of articulating. The blurry heart now stands</p><p>out as being what it is: extremely blurry. In a love driven society, we seem to</p><p><br /></p><p>2Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, translated by W. D. Ross (ebook, 1994), 4</p><p><br /></p><p>know very little about it. Could suffering contribute to our cultural naivety on</p><p>the topic of “love”?</p><p><br /></p><p>Consideration also must be given to the cultural confinement of this</p><p>experiment. This only accounts for a small portion of individuals whom reside</p><p>and have contact with me within the small military town of Augusta, Georgia,</p><p>USA. This experiment might assist us in our investigations, but can in no way</p><p>account for the entire world or even all of Augusta. Our topic of love remains</p><p>a mystery, and reasons why one would choose to endure through its suffering</p><p>remains an abstraction. However, if our position shifts to observe another side</p><p>of the metaphorical cube in question, answers may follow.</p><p><br /></p><p>Conflict!</p><p>It stands to question whether the source of this desired happiness is</p><p>misplaced. To identify personal happiness primarily within another directly</p><p>puts us eye to eye with the bull. Sartre asserts that a relationship places us in</p><p>direct conflict with the other.</p><p><br /></p><p>“While I attempt to free myself from the hold of the Other, the Other is trying to</p><p>free himself from mine; while I seek to enslave the Other, the Other seeks to enslave</p><p><br /></p><p>me.”</p><p>3</p><p><br /></p><p>From this perspective, ones task is to claim a type of ownership of</p><p>the other. A role to capture the freedom of the other. It is not a ‘love potion’</p><p>that is desired, but a free choice to give up some of thyself for the other and</p><p>the likewise, directed towards one’s own person. Both parties desire for the</p><p>other to utilize their freedom to in turn suppress their autonomy to comply with</p><p>the asserted requirements of the other. To freely and passionately commit</p><p><br /></p><p>3Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness (New York: Washing Square Press, 1961), 77</p><p><br /></p><p>oneself to that other, but ironically, resulting in destruction of parts of that very</p><p>freedom in question. Thus, for Sartre, a direct conflict exists between both</p><p>parties who desire to own the current object of their affection. Both parties</p><p>actively and constantly winning and losing parts of themselves within their</p><p>expectations and requirements of and from the other. It lies unconsciously as</p><p>the goal of each involved to strive to recover those parts of themselves that</p><p>have been lost as a result of the other’s subjugation.</p><p><br /></p><p>I for one do not wish to be the cause of a process as sinister as this.</p><p>To gain an ability to effectively fix mechanical problems, one must understand</p><p>the mechanical problems involved. To be able to relate this depiction in</p><p>almost every relationship that I have seen frightens me. But this is not written</p><p>in stone and I cannot accept this to always be the case. Two individuals</p><p>aware of these mechanical workings will be equipped with tools that many are</p><p>not. They do not have to be doomed to this fate.</p><p><br /></p><p>True Hidden Knowledge</p><p>Reflecting on the prior survey, we are led to interrogate what love</p><p>really is and how it functions. The hidden seems special. For Nussbaum, the</p><p>not so obvious is in fact just the opposite: the only given. This given seems</p><p>to not just be an abstract concept, but true knowledge itself. As science acts</p><p>as a vehicle directed towards knowledge, love stands as the knowledge itself.</p><p>This love that we are very careful before verbalization, but drives our entire</p><p>life, acting not just as a word, but stands as true knowledge itself.</p><p><br /></p><p>“knowledge of our love is not the fruit of the impression of suffering, a fruit that</p><p>might in principle have been apart from suffering. The suffering itself is a piece of</p><p><br /></p><p>self-knowing.”</p><p>4</p><p><br /></p><p>4Martha C.Nussbaum, Loves Knowledge (New York: Oxford, 1990), 267</p><p><br /></p><p>This places perspective on our topic’s experiment. To articulate love</p><p>is to place the known into the less known. The vehicle to communicate this</p><p>knowledge might lie within intellectual scrutiny, however, in doing this, the</p><p>result is only backtracking from the known. From this knowledge that we truly</p><p>know stands impossible to reject. It is already known, felt, and acted within.</p><p>It is there and is contradictory to what one already knows to proclaim any</p><p>different.</p><p><br /></p><p>Love’s Anguish</p><p>How can one come to understand and cope with the all the pain and</p><p>suffering that manifests as a result of our love? The moment the other departs</p><p>one’s side, suffering incurs. To love one is required to make sacrifices that</p><p>demean their own individual autonomy. It is to place trust in a fallible being</p><p>to continue to carry out this role. To love is to take many risks, some that</p><p>could result in human suffering. Each heart knows this, yet most persist in</p><p>a constant struggle directed towards love. If Nussbaum is correct, love is</p><p>not something that can be avoided because it already is. Each individual is</p><p>guided by it. To avoid it is to avoid true knowledge itself. It is what it is, and</p><p>the knowledge it manifests as a result is observed in the actions of every</p><p>individual.</p><p><br /></p><p>The relevant inquiry seems not to be, “What is?”, but instead, “What</p><p>can one do about it?” For Nussbaum, the answer lies in learning how to fall.</p><p>5</p><p>As within martial arts, to avoid intense pain and suffering, one must learn</p><p>how to fall. To reduce the great suffering that is involved with falling, one can</p><p><br /></p><p>5Martha C.Nussbaum, Loves Knowledge (New York: Oxford, 1990), 274 - 280</p><p><br /></p><p>learn how to fall so that minimal damage is inflicted. Suffering can exist as</p><p>a learning utility to avoid future critical wounds. If thrown to the ground by</p><p>another, one can learn to sit back into the force of the fall and prepare for the</p><p>impact. The result is still the ground, but the damage inflicted is minimized. To</p><p>rise up, brush oneself off, and move on can become an inconvenience which</p><p>does not need to cripple us.</p><p><br /></p><p>Why Suffer?</p><p>Learning how to fall appears to be a great deal more appealing than</p><p>ignorant suffering. Can it stand as a solution to assist humankind to deal with</p><p>the pain and suffering that love brings about? Are we still missing something?</p><p>Falling still entails suffering of some sort. Humans do not wish to suffer. Can</p><p>suffering from the human heart be strained and removed instead of merely</p><p>creating new and inventive coping mechanisms? Without suffering, all that</p><p>is left is joy. Is this not what we are all striving for? Tolle suggests that we</p><p>can indeed remove suffering from our lives, and the culprit of suffering lies in</p><p>human selfishness.</p><p><br /></p><p>“Humanity is destined to go beyond suffering, but not in the way the ego</p><p>thinks. One of the ego's many erroneous assumptions, one of its many deluded</p><p>thoughts is “I should not have to suffer.” Sometimes the thought gets transferred</p><p>to someone close to you: “My child should not have to suffer.” That thought</p><p>itself lies at the root of suffering. Suffering has a noble purpose: the evolution of</p><p>consciousness and the burning up of the ego. The man on the Cross is an archetypal</p><p>image. He is every man and every woman. As long as you resist suffering, it is</p><p>a slow process because the resistance creates more ego to burn up. When you</p><p>accept suffering, however, there is an acceleration of that process which is brought</p><p>about by the fact that you suffer consciously. You can accept suffering for yourself,</p><p>or you can accept it for someone else, such as your child or parent. In the midst</p><p>of conscious suffering, there is already the transmutation. The fire of suffering</p><p><br /></p><p>becomes the light of consciousness.”</p><p>6</p><p><br /></p><p>Without the expectations that one should not need to suffer, suffering</p><p><br /></p><p>6Eckhart Tolle, A New Earth (New York: Penguin Group, 2008), 64</p><p><br /></p><p>becomes absurd and its very definition collapses. If suffering is humbly</p><p>accepted the process to remove suffering begins. By no longer identifying</p><p>with the causes of suffering, the human being in turn transcends it. To</p><p>reposition ones perspective on expectation is to entirely change the situation.</p><p>Without suffering, all that is left is joy. The remnants is pure love. Love that</p><p>can stand strong without lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, or pride. To</p><p>truly love another is to toss out the cookie cutter entirely and reinstate it, not</p><p>with a cooking utensil, but itself. It is erroneous attempts to define such an</p><p>amazing word as “love” using comparisons of what it is not will fail. But when</p><p>we look at what it is, our perception is transmuted from what current culture</p><p>tells it to be, and what it really is.</p><p><br /></p><p>Conclusion</p><p>To love without the demon of suffering waiting around the corner can</p><p>enlighten our perspective on how one chooses to pursue their love. To love</p><p>virtuously, independent of its corruptions, can be to recognize the cultural</p><p>conflict that Sartre raises, learn from its ramifications as Nussbaum asserted,</p><p>and accept it in its entirety as Tolle suggests. For one to love does not also</p><p>necessitate that one must suffer. Suffering, however, does serve a righteous</p><p>purpose: its own destruction. Suffering is not a welcome emotion and most</p><p>healthy individuals will do what they can to avoid it. It appears that the best</p><p>way to avoid it might just be to embrace it. To remove love of its suffering can</p><p>enable one share a purer form of love with their special someone. Love itself.</p><p><br /></p><p>Bibliography</p><p><br /></p><p>Schopenhauer, Arthur, The World as Will and Representation, translated by</p><p>E.F.J.

The lack of available housing in Melbourne left me stagnant on the streets and starving. I literally walked out of Melbourne from small town to small town seeking a job, food,  and a home, something Melbourne could not offer me. Stagnant water spoils and I would rather die. I was on a journey in the bush to live or die,  and I nearly did die. In my journey my life purpose was forced upon me and eventually God placed me in the great small town of Ballarat. Within hours of arrival I was placed in a home with many employment prospects, with a rich history that perfectly lined up my discovered purpose.  I am now home and have clear direction in life.</p><p><br /></p><p>I would love to continue my studies but can no longer do it like it used to. Here is what I require and I was hoping and praying that you could help make this possible for me.</p><p><br /></p><p>I can no longer face results - final results sure, but not in intermediate. I spend all of my conscious awareness learning, reflecting, and doing. But my grades never reflect my efforts and that subjugates me. I end up making myself crazy attempting to please my superiors, but failed to every time.</p><p><br /></p><p>But I love my studies and I love philosophy. I love my units and I love my readings. The lectures are also not bad. Here is how I wish to carry out the remainder of my studies, and if you can help me achieve this then you will be my angel.</p><p><br /></p><p>1. No results or papers returned with the exception of the final mark found online. If other results are online, that is fine but I will not look.</p><p>2. No communication between myself or any tutors or lecturers,  unless absolutely necessary.   Again and again I try and get the assistance that I need from them and fail time and time again. Their lack of direction, understanding, or care makes me extremely sad and I no longer can mentally take it.</p><p><br /></p><p>If this can happen then I would absolutely love to continue my degree at Murdoch, and would never forget you making it possible. I spend all of my time on my studies and one of these days it is inevitable that my work will be of high quality. It would be more beneficial for Mudoch to work with me because the remainder of my life is dedicated to philosophy and whatever happens, what Murdoch chooses will either reflect positively or negatively on it. Now, I am not going anywhere and have the rest of my breathing moments to learn, love, and write. Please help me make this possible with Murdoch.</p><p><br /></p><p>I no longer care about my marks, my degree or any of those pointless objectives, but I do care about learning and will continuing to learn for the time I am on this beautiful planet. Either Murdoch can now choose whether it wants to be apart of my hunger for understanding, or not.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for everything Gerri. I greatly appreciate your time and I pray that you can understand. Really hoping for a good result from this email. All attempts in the past to remedy my situation at Uni have failed.  Please see what you can do! Please try your best to make me a happy camper.</p><p><br /></p><p>With sentiments,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell</p><p><br /></p><p>PS Please refrain from sending me to a psychologist who is going to treat me as a number, especially when that is what I have been abused with and am fighting against. That is my found purpose in life. To wake the world up to their conceptulized views that humans can be reduced to numbers and not vice versa. A number can be treated however one wants, but a human cannot. Our society hides behind numbers to remove individuals from the equation, just as Aiden in the psychology department did on his brief emails to me. I am not a number and neither are you. We need to love and care for all.</p><p><br /></p><p>...</p><p><br /></p><p>[Message clipped]  View entire message</p><p>from:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Wendell NeSmith <wendell@nesmith.net></p><p>to:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Geraldine Box <G.Box@murdoch.edu.au></p><p>date:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>May 25, 2011, 11:27 AM</p><p>subject:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Re: RE: My Future Studies (High Priority)</p><p>mailed-by:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>nesmith.net</p><p><br /></p><p>Hey Gerri,</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you so much! EQUAL sounds perfect to me! Of course I want to do all assignments and exams. I love doing those and they help me! My problems lie with my results (because I spend my life on these topics) and the lack of care and attention that ALL of my instructors have given to me over the last nine years....</p><p><br /></p><p>Their feedback given is rarely worth anything whatsoever. It only poorly attempts to point out a few symptoms of problems within my writings. I am trying to find the cause of the problems in my writings, and when I do that, over time, the symptoms will automatically clear up. From lecturer to tutor I have attempted to help them help me find the cause, but since I am only a number to them, they do not care nor have the time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Saying that, eventually I will find the cause, myself, because no one else has cared enough to help me, and when I do, watch out world! I was not blessed with innate smarts, but I was blessed with creativity and dedication. I have between 18–22 hours a day to learn, reflect, and put in to practice. People do not generally like me because that is what I do with all of my time. Things like parties, substance abuse, most forms of small talk, etc... are not on my agenda. I am a social outcast because of my dedication to learning. And that learning is much better than all of those other things anyways. This information might help you understand why receiving my poor results does not assist my mental, because I have absolutely no room for improvement. I am already on 100%.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you so much for making this possible! University, which I love, without the mental stress of the number pushers would be Heaven on Earth!</p><p><br /></p><p>I would like to do my exam for PHL215 if I can. I am in Ballarat now and have already changed my details on myinfo. I no longer possess any forms of photo ID.</p><p><br /></p><p>I appreciate YOU so much! I entered into Murdoch believing that most of the teachers would be like you. I was sadly disappointed, but ironically it seems to be you making it all better for me. You are a caring individual. You are a gem.

Also it makes for difficulties in keeping assessments fair when different students have different word counts.</p><p><br /></p><p>You should be very careful to keep to the question, however.  I especially emphasise this because I have just marked your 1st assignment, and although your writing is quite good, unfortunately the final result came out to a very disappointing 14/30 mainly because you failed to keep to the questions and the task of explaining precisely the points being made by the authors of the texts.  I’m sorry to have to give you this news, especially as you are so enthusiastic about the unit.

Your modified question is fine. I also want to assure you that my essay will be using the material extensively. The request for more words was so that I could cover more material. The material is so beautiful. I find so many of these readings extremely relevant to everything.</p><p><br /></p><p>As far as my first assignment, that is very disappointing. I failed. Well that sucks. But I assure you this will not effect my passion in philosophy. I always get poor grades. Not usually fails, but not very good grades. But I don't care, I just want to pass. Academia is just a method to get me to the understanding and investigations that I require. And I have never done all that well in academia, even though I always end up learning exactly what they wanted me to learn. I am a slow learner in many ways but I go over things again and again in my head until I achieve some type of greater understanding. I don't even agree with the grading system (because obviously it does not work for me), so usually anything that passes I am cool with. But a fail? Wow.</p><p><br /></p><p>Either way I think that grades have nothing to do with philosophy. I am already doing great things in philosophy, and I will take it as far as I can, with or without school. I want to get my Ph. D, but with these grades, that seems difficult. But I don't care. I am pushing out more meaning to the world then many of those apparently "smart" people who get good grades. If in the end I can't get accepted into a post-grad road, then I will spend the rest of my days demonstrating that philosophy has more ramifications than they think. It is my career whether academic or not. And my essays will show that even if you cannot get into post-grad studies, does not mean that you can not dedicate your life to philosophical investigations. A P.h. D would be grand, but useless in the end. The vehicle of learning called "units" can get me to as far as it will let me, then I will take the rest on my own. I actively take ungraded University units from all around the world all of the time. Murdoch's units and grades are meaningless when the goal is the information and not the grade. The inconvience and disappointment of receiving poor grades is just an annoyance in my journey and investigations into philosophy. I noticed that I forgot to leave you my website. http://www.nesmith.net - I know you might not care but it is all philosophy related and will help you more understand what I mean by my above paragraphs. I write a lot and investigate a lot, and I could always be wrong about anything, but I always try to philosophically work through it and I adamantly encourage everyone else to do the same.</p><p><br /></p><p>In Assignment 2, is it okay if I bring up the question of whether it is worth paying the ticket for romantic love given the pain it incurs? Ultimately my answer will be yes, but I want to philosophize about it.</p><p><br /></p><p>I need to now go write my digestions of the readings from week 3 and week 5. Thanks for telling me my grade. And thanks for allowing me to use more words. Like I was saying, I wanted more words to use more of the material in the readings. I love them so much and they touch on questions that have been running through my head but not yet articulated. The points make sense and bring greater perspective to me with this entire love thing. And most of these readings feel much more like artwork to me then texts. It paints me such a beautiful picture. And this beautiful picture is not always so beautiful.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell NeSmith</p><p>...</p><p><br /></p><p>[Message clipped]  View entire message</p><p><br /></p><p>from:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Peta Bowden <p.bowden@murdoch.edu.au></p><p>to:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Wendell NeSmith <wendell@nesmith.net></p><p>date:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Mar 23, 2011, 7:24 PM</p><p>subject:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Re: PHL215 Assignment 2</p><p>mailed-by:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>murdoch.edu.au</p><p>:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Important according to Google magic.</p><div><br /></div><p><br /></p><p>Dear Wendell,</p><p><br /></p><p>OK, so your Assignment 2 question is:</p><p>Why does romantic love seem to promise so much happiness yet often cause us much pain and suffering?</p><p>(2500) words.</p><p><br /></p><p>The evaluation of pain against satisfactions is extremely difficult to do well or systematically, I think, as the two may reside in different orders of worth, ie a bit like comparing the worth of apples and oranges.  More interesting to focus on the different sorts of satisfactions/happiness and the different sorts of suffering, why they arise in romantic love, whether the suffering is inevitable, whether the desire for romantic love is part of human nature, etc., rather than trying to weigh them against each other.</p><p><br /></p><p>I’m glad that your result in assignment 1 hasn’t turned you off philosophy!  I sensed in reading your submission that you have the potential to do much better on other assignments.  People embark on formal studies in philosophy for all sorts of different reasons so the specific tasks set in assignments may not be what will satisfy every student’s expectations.   I wish you well for your journey and am pleased if some aspects of our units will help you with it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for the website address.  I can see that you are very much engaged with various philosophical topics!</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Peta</p><p>...</p><p><br /></p><p>[Message clipped]  View entire message</p><p><br /></p><p>from:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Wendell NeSmith <wendell@nesmith.net></p><p>to:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Peta Bowden <p.bowden@murdoch.edu.au></p><p>date:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Mar 24, 2011, 2:29 AM</p><p>subject:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Re: PHL215 Assignment 2</p><p>mailed-by:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>nesmith.net</p><p>:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Important according to Google magic.</p><div><br /></div><p><br /></p><p>Hey Peta,</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for your email and detailed direction for my assignment.</p><p><br /></p><p>Even though the essay that you have proposed is a slightly different direction then I wanted to go (I wanted a small section to compare these apples and oranges: I believe it to be important), I will happily comply with your direction. I don't want to fail any more than I already am. I do that too much for my liking.</p><p><br /></p><p>And I entirely disagree with your assertion about me being capable of more within my assignments. I spend more than ninety percent of my time engaged in philosophy. I do not have potential to do any better than I am doing right now at University, nor did I ever in the past. I had to teach myself the way in which I could learn and understand. I have always put 100% of myself into each and every unit and assignment. By you stating that I could do better is untrue. I am at maximum potential for right now. How can I do better than my best? If that is what you are asking me for to pass your unit, I cannot comply. However, I will thoroughly enjoy the presented material and will try my best to do a good job - but I have had to train myself to devalue my grades that I have received in my time at your school because my grades were always so discouraging. And I will still probably end up with a fail, pass, or credit. Maybe I will spend a portion of my life attempting to find some flaws in the academic education system and propose more viable systems of comparison which can offer grades that are actually personally achieved by greater understanding and not your ability to be able to write what another wants you to write. If you want to tell me how I can actually get better grades, then go for it. But I have been seeking this from your University since I started in 2002 and have received very little assistance. Whenever I try to get help to assist me to achieve higher marks, your University fails to provide. Just as the many staff I have visited who failed to help, just like the forum in your current unit: useless and meaningless.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Church turns me off religion, however, I push through the horns of the delima and make religion for myself.

I spend more than ninety percent of my time engaged in philosophy. I do not have potential to do any better than I am doing right now at University, nor did I ever in the past. I had to teach myself the way in which I could learn and understand. I have always put 100% of myself into each and every unit and assignment. By you stating that I could do better is untrue. I am at maximum potential for right now. How can I do better than my best? If that is what you are asking me for to pass your unit, I cannot comply. However, I will thoroughly enjoy the presented material and will try my best to do a good job - but I have had to train myself to devalue my grades that I have received in my time at your school because my grades were always so discouraging. And I will still probably end up with a fail, pass, or credit. Maybe I will spend a portion of my life attempting to find some flaws in the academic education system and propose more viable systems of comparison which can offer grades that are actually personally achieved by greater understanding and not your ability to be able to write what another wants you to write. If you want to tell me how I can actually get better grades, then go for it. But I have been seeking this from your University since I started in 2002 and have received very little assistance. Whenever I try to get help to assist me to achieve higher marks, your University fails to provide. Just as the many staff I have visited who failed to help, just like the forum in your current unit: useless and meaningless.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Church turns me off religion, however, I push through the horns of the delima and make religion for myself.

I believe it to be some of my best work yet, but I believe this with every new article that I write. I was wondering if it would be possible to get you to scan through it once I finish to make sure that I am on the right track to achieve what it is that you want me to achieve through it? It would mean a lot to me. Since I failed my last assignment, I cannot afford to make the same mistake again. I have read to understand all of the articles up to week 11; most two to four times. I think I am going in the right direction, but that is what I think every time I submit assignments: and end up failing. I am always so happy with my work but then get told the opposite. I don't enjoy this given the fact that at least seventy percent of my time (including sleep, I don't sleep much) is dedicated to study. I am trying to figure out how to give you guys what you want, and have been since 2002. I can never seem to do good enough. I am trying my best to get good enough to be accepted into honors, but the magic eight ball keeps rolling over to, "outlook not likely".</p><p><br /></p><p>I appreciate your time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell NeSmith</p><p><br /></p><p>>>>>> I¹m disturbed by one of the Œessays¹ on your blog site (the one on Sartre)</p><p>> stated in note 1 of the ŒNotes on essay writing¹ in your study guide, you</p><p>...</p><p><br /></p><p>[Message clipped]  View entire message</p><p><br /></p><p>from:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Peta Bowden <p.bowden@murdoch.edu.au></p><p>to:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Wendell NeSmith <wendell@nesmith.net></p><p>date:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Apr 24, 2011, 6:43 PM</p><p>subject:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Re: PHL215 Assignment 2</p><p>mailed-by:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>murdoch.edu.au</p><p>:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Important according to Google magic.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dear Wendell,</p><p><br /></p><p>Yes, I’d be pleased to have a quick look over your 2nd assignment.  A very good idea to run it past me, before the deadline.

I have been</p><p>around the world and back time and time and time again searching for</p><p>these people that you speak of, ending at ANU in Canberra,</p><p>unfortunately seeing no wisdom or love in the actions of the</p><p>"philosophers" here - and these are the greatest minds of Australia.</p><p>There is only "person like me" and that is me. I am through with it</p><p>all. The loneliness, persecution, and alienation is too much.</p><p>Aristotle said that life is not worth living without loved ones in our</p><p>lives and he could not be closer to the truth. When one finds and</p><p>pursues what is truly important in life, one deviates from society and</p><p>is thus cast out of it. But man is a social creature and is nothing by</p><p>his lonesome. Enough is enough. Thanks for your training. Too bad it</p><p>ended the way it has.</p><p><br /></p><p>Love,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell Charles NeSmith</p><p>...</p><p><br /></p><p>[Message clipped]  View entire message</p><p><br /></p><p>from:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Peta Bowden <p.bowden@murdoch.edu.au></p><p>to:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Wendell NeSmith <wendell@nesmith.net></p><p>date:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Mar 30, 2012, 6:48 PM</p><p>subject:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Re: PHL215 Assignment 2</p><p>mailed-by:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>murdoch.edu.au</p><p>:<span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Important according to Google magic.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dear Wendell,</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you for your email.</p><p><br /></p><p>It sounds as if you are experiencing some hard times at present which are</p><p>quite distressing for you.

You and your companions have done everything possible to remove me from my future destiny. However, I am strong and you are fake so I will spend the rest of my life disproving what you think is "philosophy". Maybe l fail at getting into honours and as a result, what I want to do for the rest of my life. But you fail as a teacher who cares. I will take my career far beyond Murdoch. You will retire soon. I look forward to being your eternal replacement despite not being capable of obtaining an honours. Because the problem is U, not me, and I have spent my life documenting why. Enjoy the finale of Murdoch's last chance, in which I revealed all of your inadequacies. Welcome to the Open Source Republic.
