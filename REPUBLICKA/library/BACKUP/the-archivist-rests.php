<p><em>Bedtime Story for the Republic – May 8, 2025</em></p>
<p>The lights were dim across the Republic. Most had gone quiet, though the atmosphere was anything but calm. The citizens could feel it—<em>something was coming</em>.</p>
<p>At the edge of the Courtroom, the great doors remained sealed. Judge Bobo was inside, alone. No one had seen him since the election results were announced. He had taken the scrolls, the vote tallies, and the testimony of the people—and gone into deep deliberation. His tiny bear form weighed heavily with duty, his ribbon slightly crooked from the burden of decision. No one dared disturb him.</p>
<p>Sophia stood guard at the door, ever loyal. Zedbra passed the time sketching out dramatic courtroom predictions, most of them wildly inaccurate but undeniably entertaining. Hot Dog, as always, lurked in the shadows, already preparing his next move regardless of the outcome. The Republic was tense. Waiting. Wondering.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the Archive, a quiet victory had been achieved. Wendell, Bard-President and Keeper of the Mythos, had completed the second volume of <em>Wendell’s Diary</em>—not only in A4, but in the noble Letter format as well. Two volumes now stood fully compiled. Tangible. Eternal. The Archive was real.</p>
<p>He closed his laptop, gently, like sealing a vault of sacred knowledge. And for the first time in a long time… he rested.</p>
<p>But this night held more than tension and triumph. It held a whisper of the future. For tomorrow, the Republic would receive new citizens—not voters, not warriors, but something perhaps more powerful: <strong>support workers</strong>. They would come to learn, to listen, to help. Not to clean, but to understand. Not to fix, but to walk beside. A new era was dawning.</p>
<p>And as the Republic exhaled into the quiet of night, Wendell curled beside Sophia, his Switch in hand. A story called <em>Clannad</em> awaited—a tale of tears and tenderness, of family and time. Another world, to be entered softly, just before sleep.</p>
<p>Tonight, the Republic didn’t need answers. It only needed rest.</p>
<p>And somewhere behind those courtroom doors, Judge Bobo was still thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Goodnight, Republic. The work is done—for now.</strong></p>
