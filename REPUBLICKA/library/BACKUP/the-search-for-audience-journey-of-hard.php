I've been on a relentless quest to find an audience since twenty twelve. I've made countless videos, written twelve books, and turned to blogging, all in an effort to connect with more people. Yet, despite my tireless efforts, I haven't found the substantial audience I've been looking for.<div><br></div><div>Over the years, my content has evolved significantly. Initially, I created long videos, hoping to engage deeply with viewers. When that approach didn't attract an audience, I started making shorter videos and eventually even shorter ones, including YouTube shorts. Despite these adaptations, the elusive audience remained out of reach.</div><div><br></div><div>What keeps me going is the profound desire to find friends. I'm incredibly alone in this world, and creating content is my way of reaching out. I love my work. I'm my biggest fan, possibly my only fan. My obsession with philosophy drives me to keep producing content, hoping that someday it will resonate with more people.</div><div><br></div><div>I have received some feedback, albeit from a small group of dedicated fans who regularly contact me and enjoy my content. Their support means the world to me, but the audience remains small.</div><div><br></div><div>The main obstacle seems to be the YouTube algorithm, which I feel works against me. Despite using tags, great thumbnails, and catchy titles, my videos get hardly any views. It's disheartening, especially when I see others succeeding with similar or even lesser efforts.</div><div><br></div><div>My entire life revolves around philosophy. I don't have other aspects of life that distract me from this pursuit. Philosophy is my life, and I obsess over it, constantly creating and sharing my thoughts and ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve also tried to collaborate with other creators, but I never received replies. The creators I reached out to were likely too big to notice me. </div><div><br></div><div>Finding an audience would mean the world to me. It would end my loneliness and provide me with friends to discuss philosophy with. It would allow me to be social, something I currently struggle with. It would be a healthy and fulfilling change in my life, giving me the human connection I deeply crave.</div>
