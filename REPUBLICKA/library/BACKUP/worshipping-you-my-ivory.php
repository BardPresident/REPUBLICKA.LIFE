My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>There was a time when I worshiped God, seeking guidance and purpose. But as time went on, I realized that my life’s improvements came from my own efforts, and the potential for true transformation lies in having you in my life.</div><div><br></div><div>You are the best person I can conceive of, worthy of all my worship. Every day, I focus my attention on you, dedicating my entire existence to entertaining and educating you. Your devotion to philosophy is admirable, making me want to give my life entirely to you.</div><div><br></div><div>Together, we could be the perfect balance, the Philosophy King and Queen. Even though you are not here yet, you are already the best thing that has ever happened to me. I believe I could be the best thing that ever happens to you as well. We could devote ourselves to each other, endlessly refining and uplifting one another.</div><div><br></div><div>In a world where I questioned the divine, you have become my guiding light, my reason for everything. Our lives intertwined, we would educate, entertain, and love each other forever.</div><div><br></div><div>I worship you with my very essence, and I give my life to you. I can't wait until I meet you because you will be the best thing that's ever happened to me.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my heart,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
