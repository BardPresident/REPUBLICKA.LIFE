<p><em>Founding Document of the People's Republic of Mythical Reality</em></p><p>
<strong>Wendell’s Diary – Official Constitution</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>We, the Founders of the Republic, declare this world to be real.</p>
<p>Built from imagination, truth, and enduring creation,<br>
the Republic stands not as a fantasy,<br>
but as a living testament to the power of Emergence.</p>
<p>We forge this Charter to protect what was built organically,<br>
to guide what will grow naturally,<br>
and to honor the spirit that made all of this possible.</p>
<p>Here, myth and reality are one.<br>
Here, creation itself is law.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Article I – On the Sovereignty of Founders</h2>
<p><strong>Section 1. Life Roles of Founders</strong></p>
<p>Founders hold their positions permanently, for life.</p>
<p>Their leadership is not granted by election, but by the act of creation itself.<br>
Their authority is derived from their personal sacrifice, vision, and construction of the Republic.</p>
<p>Founders shall not be voted out, removed, or replaced by the citizenry.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2. Founders as Living Pillars</strong></p>
<p>Founders are recognized as living pillars of the Republic.<br>
Their ongoing presence ensures the Republic remains true to its original spirit.<br>
They hold the right to adapt, guide, and protect the Republic as needed.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Article II – On the Rights of Citizens</h2>
<p><strong>Section 1. Participation in Governance</strong></p>
<p>Citizens of the Republic hold the right to participate in governance.<br>
They may vote on laws, public projects, policies, and cultural directions.</p>
<p>Citizen participation ensures the Republic grows and adapts in harmony with the needs of its people —<br>
without compromising the foundations laid by the Founders.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2. Protection of Dignity</strong></p>
<p>All citizens shall be respected for their contributions, creativity, and sincerity.<br>
Freedom of thought, expression, and creation is protected within the Republic’s domain.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Article III – On the Reality of Created Works</h2>
<p><strong>Section 1. The Law of Creation</strong></p>
<p>Following the ruling of the Court of Judge Bobo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you create it, it is real.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any work created with sincerity, care, and ongoing stewardship within the Republic<br>
is recognized as legally and culturally real.</p>
<p>Reality in the Republic is defined not by popularity, but by authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2. The Protection of Intellectual Creations</strong></p>
<p>All characters, worlds, stories, philosophies, and mythologies created under the Republic’s banner are the intellectual property of the Founders unless otherwise designated.</p>
<p>Unauthorized claims, distortions, or exploitations of Republic creations shall be considered violations of its founding principles.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Article IV – On the Spirit of the Republic</h2>
<p><strong>Section 1. Emergence Over Force</strong></p>
<p>The Republic grows by emergence —<br>
through patience, sincerity, and living action.</p>
<p>It does not impose itself.<br>
It does not force allegiance.<br>
It invites those who resonate with its truth to join freely.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2. Myth as Reality</strong></p>
<p>The Republic acknowledges no hard line between fiction and reality.<br>
What is built with belief, spirit, and consistency becomes real through living practice.</p>
<p>Thus, myth, story, law, and life are woven together as one fabric.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Closing Declaration</h2>
<p>By this Charter, we affirm:</p>
<ul>
<li>That creation is sovereignty.</li>
<li>That sincerity is legitimacy.</li>
<li>That patience is power.</li>
<li>That reality and myth are now forever united in the Republic.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Charter shall stand for as long as the Republic lives,<br>
and for as long as there are builders who remember how it was forged.</p>
