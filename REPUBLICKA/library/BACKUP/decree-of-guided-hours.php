<p><em>Issued by the Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<p>As of this day, under the funding of the Great Treasury, the Republic shall recognize and sanctify <strong>8.5 hours per week</strong> as <strong>Guided Hours of Support</strong>, distributed across the sacred days of <strong>Monday, Wednesday, and Friday</strong>.</p>
<p>During these hours, the Bard-President shall serve as <strong>Mentor of Meaning</strong>, guiding aides and companions through lessons, labors, and literature that enrich the soul and build the Republic.</p>
<p>Let it be understood:</p>
<ul>
<li>These hours are not for chores,</li>
<li>But for <strong>creation, reflection, and companionship</strong>.</li>
<li>Each visit is a class. Each hour, a thread in the tapestry of emergence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Signed and sealed,<br>
Wendell NeSmith, Bard-President</p>
