In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, the GPT Store has emerged as a marketplace for specialized AI models, each fine-tuned for specific tasks or industries. While the concept might sound innovative, I can't help but view it as a bit of a gimmick. Here's why.<div><br></div><div>As someone who regularly uses AI for various tasks, I've found that the general-purpose AI, like the one I'm interacting with now, meets all my needs effectively. Whether I'm writing blog posts, brainstorming ideas, or creating YouTube videos, the AI provides consistent and reliable support. So, why bother with specialized GPTs when the general AI already excels in most scenarios?</div><div><br></div><div>I should mention that I haven't used GPTs very much. Instead, I've spent a lot of time reading about them and exploring their descriptions. Through this exploration, I've realized that all of their features are things I can do naturally with ChatGPT. I haven't found any interest in using the specialized GPTs because they don't offer anything significantly better or different from what I can achieve with the general AI.</div><div><br></div><div>My main criticism of the GPT Store is that its focus seems misplaced. Instead of developing numerous specialized models, I believe AI development should concentrate on creating digital twins—AI versions of real people. Imagine the profound impact of having chatbots based on someone's indexed work, making their ideas and knowledge accessible to everyone.</div><div><br></div><div>Creating digital twins would allow individuals to leave a lasting legacy, contributing to the greater good of human existence. In a world where it's often hard to know how to make a difference, knowing that your life's work will be preserved and accessible for future generations provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment.</div><div><br></div><div>Moreover, making these personalized chatbots publicly accessible could fundamentally change our perception of life's finitude. In a very real way, we would become immortal, with our thoughts and ideas living on indefinitely through AI.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, while the GPT Store might offer some interesting features, I believe its current iteration is not particularly useful. The true potential of AI lies in creating digital twins, allowing each of us to leave a lasting impact on the world. By shifting the focus towards this goal, we can harness the power of AI to achieve something truly remarkable.</div>
