<p>The Founding Members of the People's Presidency</p>
<p>This document stands as a testament to those who stepped forward in the earliest days of the People’s Presidency.<br />
These individuals, known as the <strong>Founding Members</strong>, are the first to support a vision for a truly independent Australia—one where the people, not foreign rulers or corporate interests, determine their own future.</p>
<p>Their names are written here not as mere supporters, but as <strong>architects of a new republic</strong>, as pioneers who believed in the <strong>Philosophy of Emergence</strong> and the rise of a system where leadership, wisdom, and governance emerge naturally from the people.</p>
<p>To be a <strong>Founding Member</strong> is to be a part of history—not just witnessing change, but building it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>🛡️ The Founding Members</h2>
<p>(Names will be added here as they emerge—those who stand among the first will be remembered forever.)</p>

<h1>A Mythocratic Note</h1>
<p>Within the living myth of the Mythocratic Republic,<br />
<strong>Founding Members</strong> are also honored as <strong>Founding Bards of the Republic</strong>.</p>
<p>They are not merely political supporters —<br />
they are <strong>torchbearers of a new civilization</strong>,<br />
<strong>creators of a living world</strong> where sovereignty, emergence, and meaning guide the future.</p>
<p>Their names are not only recorded in the history of Australia—<br />
<strong>they are sung into the mythology of the future.</strong></p>
<p>To stand among the Founders is to stand at the very beginning of a new world.</p>
