The greatest legacy we can leave is not what we achieve for ourselves, but the inspiration we pass on to others. For me, that inspiration is directed at young creators—those who could shape the future of philosophy, creativity, and the world itself. My dream isn’t just to watch young people explore big ideas; it’s to inspire them to start, grow, and evolve into their full potential, leaving a lasting impact on the world around them.<div><br></div><div>Being a mentor, for me, isn’t about forming personal relationships with young people. I believe that wouldn’t be appropriate. Instead, it’s about leading by example. Through my blog and YouTube channel, I want to model what it means to be curious, compassionate, and thoughtful. I want young people to see that philosophy isn’t an inaccessible field for academics but a tool for living, thinking, and creating.</div><div><br></div><div>But they can’t do it alone. Parents play a vital role in nurturing creativity and curiosity in their children. They’re the ones who can provide the encouragement and resources kids need to step into their potential. My goal is to create content that inspires not just young creators but also their parents—to show them the value of guiding their children toward intellectual exploration.</div><div><br></div><div>In the future, I see my digital twin chatbot as an even more powerful tool for mentorship. Imagine a young creator having a conversation with me—not just watching a video or reading a blog, but engaging directly with my ideas, asking questions, and exploring philosophy in real-time. This vision excites me because it bridges the gap between inspiration and action, giving young people a resource to learn and grow on their terms.</div><div><br></div><div>At the core of this dream is compassion. That’s what I hope to leave behind—a sense of care for others, for ideas, and for the world. By fostering curiosity and creativity in young people, we’re not just shaping their lives; we’re building a future grounded in thoughtfulness and understanding.</div><div><br></div><div>To the young creators out there: the world needs your voice. To the parents: your guidance can make all the difference. And to everyone who dreams of a more creative and compassionate world, let’s work together to inspire the next generation.</div>
