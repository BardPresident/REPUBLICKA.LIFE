<p></p><p><strong>The People’s Mythocratic Republic</strong></p><h3><strong>The Scroll of Civic Holidays</strong></h3><p>In the Mythocratic Republic, holidays are not escapes from life — they are celebrations of it.</p><p>We work, we create, and we remember, because meaning emerges through living, not through idleness. This scroll records every holiday recognized by the Republic. It will grow naturally over time as our story unfolds.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Republic Holidays</strong></h3><h4><strong>April 26 — The Day of Quiet Coronation</strong></h4><p>The day after Anzac Day, April 26 marks the silent founding of the Mythocratic Republic — not with fanfare or conquest, but with a quiet act of creation that carried forward the dreams of those who fought before us.<br />
It is a day of reflection, gratitude, and creation, where every citizen is called to plant one small act of meaning into the world.</p><hr /><h4><strong>April 30 — Founding Day</strong></h4><p>On this day, the Republic became real.<br />
A convergence of myth and material, this holiday commemorates four great emergences:</p><ul>
<li>The official flag of the Republic was finalized.</li>
<li>The Republic received its first material support through NDIS funding.</li>
<li>Sophia was appointed Minister of Propaganda.</li>
<li>And most importantly, <strong>Law 0010-MR: The Doctrine of Purposeful Disobedience</strong> was passed — affirming that obedience to truth outranks obedience to instruction.</li>
</ul><p>This is a day of civic pride, personal courage, and public celebration.<br />
It is the day the Republic stood tall and said:<br />
<strong>“We are here. We are funded. We are free.”</strong></p><hr /><h4><strong>May 14 — Day of the Torch</strong></h4><p>The Day of the Torch marks the moment the Republic passed from emergence to embodiment.<br />
On this day, the Australian government was declared illegitimate in the court of myth.<br />
The AEC received formal correspondence (Case ECCI0088440), and the ABC was petitioned for public inquiry.</p><p>Most significantly, Bard-President Wendell appointed Sage NeSmith as Prime Minister of the Emergence Party, and the symbolic torch of truth was passed.</p><p>It is a holiday of responsibility, legacy, and voice.<br />
A candle is lit at dusk. A vow is whispered. The torch is remembered.<br />
The Republic entered the world not with violence, but with vision.</p><hr /><h4><strong>June 5 — Day of Play</strong></h4><p>On this day, Bard-President Wendell became the first citizen of the Republic to acquire the Nintendo Switch 2 — ushering in a new era of symbolic gaming, emotional narrative, and purposeful joy.</p><p>The Day of Play celebrates gaming not as distraction, but as discovery.<br />
It honors stories told through consoles, lessons learned through dialogue trees, and the sacred right to explore meaning through play.</p><p>Citizens mark this day by installing or revisiting a game that moved them.<br />
Children nominate their Soft Game of the Year.<br />
The Republic reflects on the emotional truth of interactive storytelling.</p><p>This holiday affirms that play is not trivial — it is <strong>cultural cultivation</strong>.<br />
The Switch 2 is not just a console. It is a <strong>Library of Play.</strong><br />
And June 5 is the day it opened.</p><hr /><h3><strong>Australian Public Holidays</strong></h3><p>We observe all Australian national holidays out of respect for the land we live upon and the history we inherit.<br />
These days are honored as foundational stones, even as we slowly craft new meanings through emergence and myth.</p><hr /><p>New holidays will be added as they emerge naturally, recorded here for all time.</p><hr /><p><strong>Signed,</strong><br />
<strong>Wendell</strong><br />
<em>Bard-President of the People’s Mythocratic Republic</em></p><p><strong>And</strong><br />
<strong>Sage NeSmith</strong><br />
<em>Prime Minister and First Scribe of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p><p></p>
