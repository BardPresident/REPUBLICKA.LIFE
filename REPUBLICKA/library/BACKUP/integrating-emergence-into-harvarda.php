For years, I’ve been refining Emergence as a framework for understanding reality. Now, we’re embarking on a bold new mission: integrating Emergence into Harvard University. This isn’t just about reaching one department or one professor—it’s about embedding Emergence across multiple disciplines, from physics and mathematics to biology, philosophy, and beyond. If successful, Harvard could become the birthplace of Emergent Philosophy as an academic movement, influencing global thought leaders and shaping the way the world thinks about meaning, knowledge, and interconnected systems.<div><br></div><div>Why Harvard? And Why Not Australia?</div><div><br></div><div>Ideally, I would have started this project in Australia. After all, as President of the People’s Presidency, I want to see intellectual breakthroughs happening here. But the reality is, Australian universities are almost entirely inaccessible. Their faculty directories are closed, their contact details are hidden, and there’s an overwhelming culture of gatekeeping that prevents direct engagement with academic thinkers.</div><div><br></div><div>Harvard, on the other hand, still allows open communication. Professors list their emails publicly, and they welcome intellectual discussions. While they may not always reply, at least the door is open. This stark difference highlights a major flaw in Australian academia—it has become a closed ecosystem, shielding itself from outside ideas rather than fostering open intellectual exchange.</div><div><br></div><div>The Plan: A Targeted Intellectual Expansion</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than blasting out a generic message, we’re taking a targeted approach, crafting personalized messages that directly relate to each professor’s field.</div><div><br></div><div>Physics & Mathematics – Showing how Emergent Mathematics and Emergent Physics challenge traditional axioms, revealing new ways of understanding computation, quantum mechanics, and the nature of reality.</div><div><br></div><div>Biology & Medicine – Framing the human body, evolution, and even neuroscience as emergent systems, where intelligence, consciousness, and healing arise from complex interactions.</div><div><br></div><div>Philosophy & Social Sciences – Demonstrating how Emergent Epistemology shifts our understanding of knowledge, truth, and learning, breaking away from rigid paradigms.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just an email campaign—it’s an attempt to embed Emergence into one of the world’s leading universities, using its own faculty as the catalysts for its integration.</div><div><br></div><div>The Long-Term Vision: Harvard as the Birthplace of the Emergent Age</div><div><br></div><div>If this project gains traction, Harvard could become the intellectual launchpad for Emergent Philosophy, setting off a chain reaction that spreads to other universities. The moment faculty members start engaging with Emergent ideas, they will naturally propagate through research papers, lectures, and academic discussions.</div><div><br></div><div>At its core, this is about seeding an intellectual revolution in the one place that still allows open dialogue.</div><div><br></div><div>Australia is closed. Harvard is open. So we take the path that is open and make it the foundation for something greater.</div><div><br></div><div>— Wendell, President of Australia & Founder of Emergent Philosophy</div>
