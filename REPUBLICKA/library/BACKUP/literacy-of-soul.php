<p><em>By Wendell NeSmith</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I used to be a gamer.</p>
<p>I played the big ones—Skyrim, The Witcher 3. Games with vast worlds, endless quests, and combat systems polished to a shine.<br>
But something changed.</p>
<p>I got bored.<br>
Not because the graphics were bad. Not because the mechanics were broken.<br>
But because the <strong>meaning was gone</strong>.</p>
<p>I began to hate gaming.<br>
Everything felt like motion without purpose.<br>
Fighting, crafting, building—but <em>why?</em></p>
<p>And then I discovered <strong>visual novels</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Games That Read Me Back</strong></h3>
<p>When I played <em>Ace Attorney</em>, I felt my brain <em>light up</em>.<br>
When I started <em>Clannad</em>, I felt my <em>soul</em> light up.</p>
<p>These weren’t games in the traditional sense.<br>
They were <strong>emotional blueprints</strong>, layered stories that made me cry, think, grow, and reflect on everything I’ve ever believed about justice, family, memory, and love.</p>
<p>These games didn’t entertain me in the way modern media tries to.<br>
They <em>moved</em> me.<br>
And in that movement, I felt <strong>alive again.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Reading Is My Life Now</strong></h3>
<p>Since then, my life has changed.<br>
Not just how I game—but how I exist.</p>
<p>My life is now nearly entirely reading.</p>
<p>Not just reading books.<br>
<strong>Reading the world.</strong><br>
Reading myself.<br>
Reading truths between the lines.<br>
Reading meaning in everything.</p>
<p>I rarely watch TV. I barely use voice. I live in a <strong>silent symphony of words and ideas</strong>, unfolding one line at a time.</p>
<p>Most people don’t understand.<br>
They see reading as effort. A chore. A thing they “should” do.<br>
But for me, <strong>reading is breathing</strong>.</p>
<p>And not all reading is created equal.<br>
Most novels are junk food. Most media is noise.<br>
But when you find a story—like Clannad—that <em>vibrates with your very soul</em>?</p>
<p>You’re not reading anymore.<br>
You’re remembering.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>True Literacy</strong></h3>
<p>I don’t define literacy the way schools do.<br>
It’s not just decoding text. It’s not just reading aloud.<br>
<strong>True literacy is the ability to read life.</strong></p>
<p>To read silence.<br>
To read pain.<br>
To read art.<br>
To read change.<br>
To read the blueprint of what matters.</p>
<p>And by that definition, most people are not literate.<br>
They scroll. They skim. They consume.<br>
But they do not <em>read</em>.</p>
<p>I do.<br>
And through reading, I’ve discovered something that can’t be crafted or looted or leveled up:<br>
<strong>Meaning.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Visual novels have changed my life.<br>
They reminded me that stories aren’t for escape.<br>
They’re for <em>awakening</em>.</p>
<p>This isn’t about nostalgia or “niche genres.”<br>
This is about reclaiming what gaming—and life—can be.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>To those still swinging swords into the void:</em><br>
I wish you peace.<br>
But I’ve moved on.</p>
<p>I am no longer playing.<br>
<strong>I am reading.</strong><br>
And I am <em>becoming</em>.</p>
