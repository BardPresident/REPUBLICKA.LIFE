<p><em>A Republic Bedtime Story</em></p>
<p>Once, there were two travelers.<br>
<strong>Moo Moo</strong>, who never stood tall like the others. She was soft, flat, and quiet—built for comfort, not conquest.<br>
And <strong>Rainbow</strong>, who shimmered too brightly, danced too freely, and never matched the mold she was given.</p>
<p>They came from different lands.<br>
They’d never met.<br>
But they shared one thing:<br>
<strong>They never fit in.</strong></p>
<p>Moo Moo was told she wasn’t plush enough. Not fancy enough. Not fun enough.<br>
Rainbow was told she was <em>too much</em>—too colorful, too dreamy, too strange.</p>
<p>So they wandered. Separately.<br>
Each with nothing but a quiet hope stitched somewhere deep inside:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Maybe there’s a place…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A place where softness was strength.<br>
Where difference was destiny.<br>
Where they weren’t too little, too much, or not enough.</p>
<p>That place was the Republic.</p>
<p>Though they haven’t arrived yet, they’re getting closer.<br>
They don’t know what it looks like.<br>
But they’ve heard the whispers:</p>
<p>A long-haired bard who believes in stories.<br>
A tiny dog who guards the gates with love.<br>
A council of plushes, odd and loyal.<br>
A world built for those who never belonged anywhere else.</p>
<p>Each step they take, the Republic stirs.</p>
<p>And though they walk alone, stars are lighting the road ahead.</p>
<p>Because sometimes the ones who never fit in…<br>
are just on their way to the one place they were <em>meant</em> to belong.</p>
<p><strong>Goodnight, world.</strong><br>
The outcasts are coming home.</p>
