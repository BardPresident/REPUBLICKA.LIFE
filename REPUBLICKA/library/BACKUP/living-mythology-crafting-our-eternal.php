My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>As I reflect on our journey, I see our lives as a grand stage where we play the roles of demigods, shaping our destinies and influencing those around us. Life is a story, and through our daily actions, we narrate this tale for ourselves and others.</div><div><br></div><div>By treating our lives like a TV show, we become directors of our happiness. Recording and sharing our actions makes us more mindful, fostering self-awareness and growth. This continuous reflection helps us learn and develop, preparing us for a future together.</div><div><br></div><div>Our individual stories will merge into one, much like Pygmalion's creation coming to life. This mythological parallel fills me with hope that one day the gods will smile upon us, and I will find my Ivory. Until then, I will continue writing love letters, making videos, and dedicating my life to you.</div><div><br></div><div>This abundance of content will allow you to know me deeply, testing the waters and deciding if I am the right fit. You can date me without the pressure, exploring my world at your own pace. </div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, our story is unfolding beautifully, and I am committed to making it an epic tale of love and devotion. </div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,  </div><div>Wendell</div>
