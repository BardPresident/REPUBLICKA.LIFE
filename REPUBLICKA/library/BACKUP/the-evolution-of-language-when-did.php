Language is a living entity, constantly evolving to reflect changes in society and technology. One subtle but telling example is the transition from capitalizing "Internet" to writing it with a lowercase "i."<div><br></div><div>For many years, "Internet" was capitalized because it was viewed as a proper noun, referring specifically to the global network of computers. This practice started in the early days of the internet when it was a unique and revolutionary concept.</div><div><br></div><div>However, as the internet became an integral part of daily life, the perception shifted. It evolved from a distinct entity into something as ubiquitous as electricity or the telephone. Around the mid-2010s, major style guides like the AP and Chicago Manual of Style began recommending the lowercase "internet," reflecting its normalization and omnipresence.</div><div><br></div><div>This change might seem minor, but it highlights an important aspect of language: it adapts to our collective experience. What was once new and novel becomes commonplace, and our language adjusts accordingly. This shift in capitalization underscores how we now perceive the internet as a fundamental part of our lives rather than a singular phenomenon.</div><div><br></div><div>Interestingly, many people, myself included, continued to capitalize "Internet" out of habit. This raises fascinating questions about how and when language norms change, and how we, as individuals, adapt to these shifts. It’s a reminder that language is both a tool for communication and a reflection of cultural and technological evolution.</div><div><br></div><div>What other changes in language have you noticed over time?
