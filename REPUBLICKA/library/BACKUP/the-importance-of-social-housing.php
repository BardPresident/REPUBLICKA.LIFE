Having experienced homelessness firsthand, I understand deeply the critical role that social housing plays in improving lives. For five years, I was without a home, traveling long distances to sleep in the wilderness because I couldn’t sleep on the streets. I was in constant search of a home, moving from place to place, unable to afford the bond for a rental.<div><br></div><div>Receiving social housing from the Australian government was a turning point in my life. It allowed me to establish a routine, develop good practices, and spend time at home focusing on my personal growth. I could study, make videos, and write blogs in a stable and safe environment, something I couldn’t fully do while homeless. The stability and security of having a home made me feel much healthier and better overall.</div><div><br></div><div>Since being housed, I have been able to collect things, get a dog, and enjoy a much-improved life. I’ve found stability and financial security, and everything in my life has been getting better and better. The foundation of having shelter allowed me to build a meaningful and fulfilling life.</div><div><br></div><div>I firmly believe that shelter is a human right. There’s no way someone can flourish when they’re homeless. Without stability, security, and safety, it’s impossible to thrive. Homelessness exposes individuals to countless risks and creates an environment of constant uncertainty and fear.</div><div><br></div><div>Social housing has the power to transform lives and communities. We should work towards eradicating homelessness entirely by providing services that quickly address and resolve the issues that lead to homelessness. Studies have shown the reasons behind homelessness and what can be done to fix it. We need our government and collective society to step in and offer the necessary support and services to those in need. It’s their responsibility to ensure that we all have the opportunity to live good lives.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the biggest challenges in providing social housing is funding. While money is often cited as the main obstacle, it’s crucial to recognize that some things in life are more important than money. The well-being and stability of individuals should take precedence.</div><div><br></div><div>To improve access to social housing, governments and communities need to act faster. Current systems are often slow, leaving individuals homeless for extended periods. Being stuck in the system without any idea of when action will be taken or when you will find a home is incredibly stressful. Accelerating these processes can help reduce the time people spend in homelessness and provide them with the security and stability they need much sooner.</div><div><br></div><div>Social housing is not just about providing a roof over someone’s head; it’s about giving them a foundation to build their lives upon. It’s about ensuring everyone has the opportunity to thrive and contribute to society. Shelter is a fundamental human right, and it’s time we prioritize it accordingly.</div>
