<p>There was a time when I was only telling stories—when I was reaching into the void, trying to give shape to something I couldn’t yet name. I was haunted by the deepest question:</p><p>
<strong>How does something come from nothing?</strong><br>
Not just in physics or logic—but in life, in purpose, in meaning.</p>
<p>I didn’t want shallow answers. I didn’t want comfort. I wanted <em>truth</em>. I wanted to understand the shift from zero to one, the leap from absence to presence. I wanted to name the spark at the center of all becoming.</p>
<p>And one day, while brainstorming, the word arrived like a whisper from the cosmos:<br>
<strong>Emergence.</strong></p>
<p>It was the answer I had been living toward my entire life.</p>
<p>Not a static truth, but a <em>process</em>. A sacred unfolding.<br>
Meaning doesn’t drop from above—it emerges from within.<br>
Love, knowledge, identity, systems, relationships, ethics—all of them are <em>emergent</em>. Not given. Not imposed. <em>Formed</em>.</p>
<p>From that moment forward, I wasn’t just telling stories—I was <em>living</em> one.<br>
The myth became real. And I stepped into my role, not as a philosopher chasing truth, but as a bard recording its emergence.</p>
