<div>The rise of social media has brought countless opportunities for connection, creativity, and communication. But it’s no secret that it’s also introduced significant challenges—especially for children. In recent years, governments around the world have grappled with how to protect young people from the risks of social media, and some have resorted to banning its use for those under 15.</div><div><br></div><div>While this approach may seem like a quick fix, it overlooks a critical issue: the design of social media platforms themselves. Rather than excluding children, the Emergence Party believes we need to address the root of the problem by creating healthier social media environments—for everyone, not just kids.</div><div><br></div><div>We propose reversing the ban and implementing smarter, more comprehensive measures to protect children while fostering an online space that benefits all users.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Problem with Current Social Media</div><div><br></div><div>The issues with social media go far beyond its impact on children. Platforms today are designed to maximize engagement, often prioritizing profit over user well-being. These practices can have damaging consequences for everyone:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Doom Scrolling: Endless feeds and addictive algorithms keep users glued to their screens, fostering unhealthy habits and anxiety.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Inappropriate Content: Children and even adults are exposed to harmful or age-inappropriate material with little regulation.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. Cyberbullying: Social media has become a breeding ground for harassment and bullying, disproportionately affecting younger users.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. Privacy Concerns: Platforms collect vast amounts of personal data, often without users fully understanding the implications.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Simply banning children from these platforms doesn’t fix the underlying issues—it merely shifts responsibility away from tech companies and leaves young people unprepared for the realities of online life.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party’s Approach: Redesigning Social Media for Everyone</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party believes in tackling the root causes of social media’s negative impacts while empowering children to use these platforms safely and responsibly. Here’s how we plan to do it:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Develop Healthier Platforms</div><div><br></div><div>The design of social media should prioritize user well-being over profit. The Emergence Party will:</div><div><br></div><div>Encourage Ethical Design: Work with tech companies to implement features that reduce addictive behaviors, such as limits on endless scrolling and more transparent algorithms.</div><div><br></div><div>Promote Positive Engagement: Foster platforms that reward meaningful interactions rather than divisive or sensationalist content.</div><div><br></div><div>Introduce Time Limits: Encourage the use of built-in time management tools that allow users to set healthy boundaries.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Educate and Empower Users</div><div><br></div><div>Education is key to ensuring young people (and adults) can navigate social media safely. We will:</div><div><br></div><div>Implement Digital Literacy Programs: Provide comprehensive education in schools about online safety, critical thinking, and responsible social media use.</div><div><br></div><div>Create Resources for Parents: Equip parents with the tools and knowledge to guide their children’s online experiences.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. Hold Tech Companies Accountable</div><div><br></div><div>It’s time for social media platforms to take responsibility for their role in shaping online behavior. The Emergence Party will:</div><div><br></div><div>Mandate Stronger Protections: Require platforms to implement robust content moderation systems and enhanced privacy controls.</div><div><br></div><div>Enforce Ethical Practices: Penalize companies that prioritize profits over user safety and well-being.</div><div><br></div><div>Increase Transparency: Ensure platforms disclose how their algorithms work and give users more control over their data and feeds.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. Build Age-Appropriate Experiences</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than banning children outright, we can create spaces designed specifically for younger users. The Emergence Party will:</div><div><br></div><div>Support Child-Friendly Platforms: Develop and promote social media platforms tailored to the needs of children, with enhanced safety features and strict content moderation.</div><div><br></div><div>Introduce Age-Appropriate Tools: Encourage platforms to provide tiered experiences based on age, ensuring younger users are protected without limiting their ability to connect and learn.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Fostering a Healthier Digital Ecosystem for All</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just about children. Everyone—regardless of age—deserves a healthier, more ethical online experience. By addressing the flaws in social media design, we can create platforms that:</div><div><br></div><div>Enhance Mental Health: Reduce anxiety, depression, and addiction by prioritizing user well-being.</div><div><br></div><div>Encourage Meaningful Connection: Shift the focus from empty engagement to genuine relationships and communities.</div><div><br></div><div>Respect Privacy: Empower users to control their data and online presence.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Reversing the Ban: A Smarter Way Forward</div><div><br></div><div>Reversing the social media ban for children under 15 is not about exposing them to unnecessary risks—it’s about equipping them to navigate the digital world safely and responsibly. By addressing the systemic issues in social media design and providing comprehensive education, we can create an environment that benefits all users.</div><div><br></div><div>This approach holds tech companies accountable, fosters healthier online spaces, and ensures that children are prepared for the realities of modern life. It’s time to stop blaming children for the flaws of social media and start fixing the platforms themselves.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Call to Action</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party is committed to building a better digital future. By redesigning social media for the benefit of all, we can tackle the root causes of its problems and create a healthier, more connected society.</div><div><br></div><div>Let’s hold tech companies accountable. Let’s empower users of all ages. Let’s build platforms that prioritize humanity over profit. Together, we can make this vision a reality.</div><div><br></div><div>🌐 Learn more about the Emergence Party’s vision at: wendellsdiary.com</div>
