<div>Running for office should mean having the opportunity to reach voters, share ideas, and engage in meaningful discussion. But in today’s world, political visibility is controlled by social media platforms and group moderators—and as an independent candidate, I’m finding out the hard way just how restrictive this system really is.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite trying to promote my campaign through social media, I am being blocked at every turn. Facebook groups won’t allow my posts, and I’m unable to advertise effectively in online spaces where political discussion should be welcome. If a candidate can’t even share their message, how can the people be expected to make informed decisions?</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just frustrating—it’s a serious problem for democracy.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Gatekeepers of Political Speech</div><div><br></div><div>Social media was once seen as a way to bypass traditional media and connect directly with the people. But in reality, it has become another barrier to entry for independent voices.</div><div><br></div><div>Here’s what I’m up against:</div><div><br></div><div>Facebook Groups Won’t Accept My Posts</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve tried to share my Emergence Party campaign, only to be met with outright rejection or silence from moderators.</div><div><br></div><div>Even in political discussion groups, my content is banned or removed, while mainstream parties dominate the conversation.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>No Organic Promotion from Social Media Algorithms</div><div><br></div><div>YouTube refuses to recommend my videos, meaning I have to pay for every single view.</div><div><br></div><div>Facebook limits reach unless I spend money on ads—ads that still face review delays and rejection risks.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>No Political Spaces for Independent Candidates</div><div><br></div><div>Most online political spaces are controlled by established parties, moderators, or influencers who only allow mainstream political content.</div><div><br></div><div>There is nowhere for truly independent political voices to be heard.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This system isn’t built for outsiders, and that’s a major problem for democracy.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>How Can an Independent Candidate Compete?</div><div><br></div><div>Political campaigns rely on visibility and engagement, but when social media platforms and group moderators shut out independent candidates, it creates an unfair playing field.</div><div><br></div><div>✅ Major parties get media coverage.</div><div>✅ They have built-in name recognition.</div><div>✅ They have access to networks that push their content to the public.</div><div><br></div><div>But what about independents?</div><div><br></div><div>I have to fight for every single view, every post, and every share. If I stop paying for promotion, my message disappears completely. This isn’t democracy—it’s algorithmic censorship and gatekeeping by social media moderators.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Bigger Problem: A Broken System</div><div><br></div><div>If social media is the new public square, then the fact that independent candidates are being blocked from participating means democracy itself is being manipulated by digital gatekeepers.</div><div><br></div><div>By refusing to allow my campaign to reach the people, social media platforms are choosing who gets to participate in the democratic process.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not just my problem—it’s a systemic issue that affects:</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 New political movements trying to gain traction</div><div>🚫 Candidates who challenge the status quo</div><div>🚫 Voters who deserve to hear all perspectives before making a decision</div><div><br></div><div>If you can’t even get your message out, what chance do you have of changing the system?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>What Needs to Change</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party believes in fair and open political discourse. We need:</div><div><br></div><div>🔹 Social media platforms to allow fair access to all candidates—not just mainstream parties.</div><div>🔹 Independent candidates to have real visibility, not just a system where you pay to be seen.</div><div>🔹 A new digital landscape that supports free and open political discussion without bias.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Call to Action</div><div><br></div><div>If social media won’t allow independent candidates to be heard, then we need to build alternative spaces where new political voices aren’t silenced.</div><div><br></div><div>I need your help to break through the barriers. Share this post, spread the word, and help push back against the digital censorship that keeps independent voices out of politics.</div><div><br></div><div>🔗 Join the fight at: wendellsdiary.com</div><div><br></div><div>Democracy should be for the people—not controlled by algorithms and moderators.</div>
