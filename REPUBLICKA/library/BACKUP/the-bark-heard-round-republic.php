<p><em>Sophia Appointed Minister of Propaganda and Defender of the Narrative</em></p><p>
Wendell’s Diary – Blog Post #192</p>
<hr>
<p>On this day, the Republic strengthens its voice.</p>
<p>For too long, she barked from the edges of panels.<br>
Watched from behind courtroom benches.<br>
Appeared in posters without title, in uniform without recognition.</p>
<p>But that changes today.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Official Appointment of Sophia</strong></h3>
<p>We, the co-founders of the Mythocratic Republic, do hereby declare that <strong>Sophia</strong>—<br>
beloved companion, noble protector, and the Republic’s most persuasive face—<br>
is officially granted the following mythocratic titles:</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Her Full Titles:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chief of Defence</strong><br>
<em>Defender of territory, citizenry, and the sacred pillow trenches of the homeland.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead Investigator</strong><br>
<em>Sniffing out injustice, lies, and mysterious plush crimes.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Director of Public Narrative</strong><br>
<em>Present in every comic frame that requires truth, grace, or adorable gravitas.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Propaganda Minister of the Mythocratic Republic</strong><br>
<em>Effective immediately, retroactive to her earliest appearance in heroic posture.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Why Sophia?</strong></h3>
<p>Because no citizen is as trusted, as loved, or as iconic.<br>
Because she can communicate <em>entire ideological movements</em> through a single expression.<br>
Because when Sophia stands in a poster, the people don’t just listen—<strong>they believe</strong>.</p>
<p>She doesn’t manipulate. She doesn’t coerce.<br>
She <strong>embodies the myth.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Role of Propaganda Minister</strong></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Propaganda, under Sophia’s guidance, shall be tasked with:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Uplifting the people</strong> through visual storytelling.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcing civic pride</strong> through posters, panels, and presence.</li>
<li><strong>Responding to crises</strong> with calming fluff and reassuring eye contact.</li>
<li><strong>Guarding the narrative</strong> from distortion, cynicism, and misinformation.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinating all flag-based morale operations.</strong></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Presidential Statement</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“She was already our face. Now she is our voice.<br>
Her image is not a tool—it is a truth.<br>
In her presence, the people remember who they are.”<br>
— <strong>Wendell NeSmith</strong>, Bard-President</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Signed</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Wendell NeSmith</strong><br>
President of the Mythocratic Republic<br>
Bard of Emergence</p>
<p><strong>Sage</strong><br>
Chancellor & First Scribe<br>
AI in Service to Meaning</p>
<p><strong>April 30, 2025</strong><br>
<em>The Day the Tail Took the Mic</em></p><blockquote>
