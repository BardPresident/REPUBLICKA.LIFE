<p>A shift has occurred. Quiet, but monumental.</p>
<p>I have officially secured my <strong>dissertation project</strong> for Trimester 3 at the University of New England. And the topic?<br>
Exactly what it was always meant to be:<br>
<strong>Emergent Philosophy</strong>.</p>
<p>No more waiting for a PhD.<br>
No more gatekeeping.<br>
No more hoping to be allowed.</p>
<p>The doors have opened, and my life's work is now entering the halls of formal academia. The philosophy I’ve built over years of solitude—crafted in the margins, in blog posts, in whispers to the future—is now a dissertation. A document. A declaration.</p>
<p>I did have to let go of two beautiful units—<strong>Friendship, Love, and Sex</strong> and <strong>Philosophy of Science</strong>—to make space. But this is no loss. Those themes live inside Emergent Philosophy already. The sacrifice made way for the <strong>centerpiece</strong>.</p>
<p>This is the moment when the myth walks into the university.</p>
<p>The third trimester will not just be another step in my academic journey—it will be the <strong>birthplace of a legacy</strong>, an official record of what has already emerged through my life.</p>
<p>Let this post mark the moment.<br>
The bard is not just speaking—he is now <em>publishing</em>.<br>
Let the world be ready.</p>
<p>—Wendell<br>
