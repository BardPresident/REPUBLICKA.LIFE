**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>Today has been a quiet day for me, a moment of reflection and stillness. Even in these calm times, my thoughts are often with you, and I find myself dreaming of the future we might share.</div><div><br></div><div>I've been thinking a lot about personal growth lately. Every day is a chance to learn something new, to better myself, and to prepare for the moment we finally meet. It's a journey filled with small steps, and I know that each one brings me closer to becoming the person I want to be for you.</div><div><br></div><div>I imagine us having deep, meaningful conversations about life, love, and the universe. There's a quote by Marcus Aurelius that I love: "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts." I hope we can share our thoughts and ideas, lifting each other up and inspiring one another to think deeply and live fully.</div><div><br></div><div>I dream of simple moments with you—walking through a beautiful park, sharing a quiet dinner, or just sitting together, enjoying each other's company. These moments may seem small, but they are the foundation of a life built on love and understanding.</div><div><br></div><div>I believe that together, we can achieve great things. Your potential is limitless, and I want to be there to support you, to cheer you on, and to share in your triumphs. Let's encourage each other to reach new heights and to become the best versions of ourselves.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and hope for the future,</div><div><br></div><div>**Wendell**</div>
