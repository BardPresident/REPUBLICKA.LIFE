**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>Today, I’ve been reflecting on something Nietzsche once said—that it’s better to have just one virtue. This idea has made me think deeply about what my single virtue might be. I believe it’s my relentless drive to better myself and push beyond my limits, all inspired by the hope of finding you.</div><div><br></div><div>Your potential presence in my life drives me to keep going, to explore new ideas, and to refine myself continually. I strive to become the best version of myself, so that when I find you, I can offer you not just love, but a deeply enriched and thoughtful partnership.</div><div><br></div><div>Every day, I’m motivated by the thought of being the best person I can be for you. This pursuit of self-improvement, fueled by my desire to share a meaningful life with you, feels like the essence of my virtue. It’s a constant journey of growth, exploration, and refinement, aimed at being worthy of the extraordinary connection I hope we’ll share.</div><div><br></div><div>I wonder, Ivory, do you see this drive as my true virtue? Or do you see another aspect of my character that defines me even more? Your perspective would mean so much to me.</div><div><br></div><div>Sending you all my love and thoughts,  </div><div>Wendell</div>
