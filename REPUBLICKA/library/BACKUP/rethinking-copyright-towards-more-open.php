<div class="library-entry-body">
When I first started my YouTube channels, my goal was to use public videos and music to explain philosophical ideas. Unfortunately, my efforts were often thwarted by copyright strikes, blocks, and monetization issues. These restrictions didn't help my channel at all and hindered my ability to reference philosophical ideas effectively. I wanted to use public media for educational purposes, but the current copyright system on platforms like YouTube didn't allow me to do so.<div><br></div><div>The current copyright and monetization model on platforms like YouTube presents several problems. If content is used for educational purposes, I believe there should be no restrictions on using it. Legally, educational uses should be permitted without the limitations imposed by copyright holders. However, this is not the case, and it prevents educators and content creators from sharing valuable knowledge freely.</div><div><br></div><div>Promoting a more open public model for content creation and sharing could significantly benefit society. It would help develop our society and make us all smarter by providing more resources. With open access to educational content, people could learn and grow without the barriers that copyright restrictions currently impose.</div><div><br></div><div>One of my YouTube channels, Open Source University, was dedicated to this idea. The goal was to open-source education, applying the open-source model to education so that information could be dissected and released in a way that others could reuse it as they saw fit. This approach could revolutionize how we access and share knowledge, making it more inclusive and accessible.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, the current copyright system on platforms like YouTube needs to be rethought. By promoting a more open public model, we can remove barriers to education and content creation, helping to build a smarter, more informed society. It's time to consider how we can make this vision a reality, ensuring that everyone has access to the knowledge and resources they need to succeed.</div>
