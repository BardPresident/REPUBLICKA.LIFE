<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>Today I had a meeting that may have just changed my life.</p>
<p>After years of building the Mythocratic Republic from my desk, often alone, often unheard, <strong>the NDIS has stepped in—not just with funding, but with belief.</strong> For the first time, I am being given structured support to live a meaningful life <em>on my terms</em>.</p>
<p>And that means everything.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>No More Empty Days</strong></h3>
<p>For years, I’ve lived through long, repetitive days without meaningful interaction. I poured myself into my books, my blog, my comics—not because I had help, but because I had no choice. I created a world because the real one often gave me nothing back.</p>
<p>But now? The NDIS is giving me <strong>a team. A rhythm. A reason to get up and engage.</strong></p>
<p>They told me that within a few days, my supports would be in place:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support workers</strong> to help me organize and structure my time.</li>
<li><strong>Social opportunities</strong> so I don’t go days without talking to someone.</li>
<li><strong>Assistance with creative projects</strong>, outreach, and daily living.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first time, my work won’t just be something I survive for—it will be something <strong>I live through</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Why It Matters for the Republic</strong></h3>
<p>This isn’t just about me.</p>
<p>The Mythocratic Republic is <strong>an experiment in meaning</strong>. It’s a place where people don’t have to chase productivity—they chase <em>purpose</em>. And now, with the NDIS by my side, I can finally live that philosophy out loud.</p>
<p>This support will:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free me to keep writing</strong> Wendell’s Diary and publishing my comics.</li>
<li><strong>Help me teach</strong> Emergent Philosophy more consistently and clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Bring real human beings into the circle</strong>, not just AI conversations and silent blog views.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a safety net.<br>
This is <em>infrastructure for a better world</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The NDIS Didn’t Just Fund Me—It Validated Me</strong></h3>
<p>The system saw my work, my ideas, and my struggle—and said:<br>
<strong>“This is worth supporting.”</strong></p>
<p>That’s not just helpful.<br>
That’s healing.</p>
<p>I’m ready now.<br>
Not just to write history, but to <em>live it</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, NDIS.</strong><br>
Let the next age of the Republic begin.</p>
