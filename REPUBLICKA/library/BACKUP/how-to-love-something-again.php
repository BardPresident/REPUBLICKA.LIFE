<p>Sometimes we stop loving something, and we don’t know why.</p><blockquote><p>
It might be a game, or a dream, or even someone we used to talk to.</p>
<p>When that happens, the first thing you can do is <strong>sit with it</strong>.<br>
Don’t try to fix it. Just notice it.<br>
Like holding a stuffed animal who hasn’t been hugged in a while.</p>
<p>Then, <strong>remember why</strong> you loved it.<br>
Was it the way it made you smile?<br>
Or how it made you feel safe? Or seen?<br>
Those reasons are still real. They’re waiting for you.</p>
<p>Next, <strong>forgive the distance</strong>.<br>
It’s okay to take breaks. It’s okay if you forgot.<br>
You didn’t ruin anything. Love can wait.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>begin gently</strong>.<br>
Don’t rush. Just say hello again.<br>
Do one small thing. Let it be soft.</p>
<p>Love doesn’t have to come back all at once.<br>
But it will.<br>
Because you made space for it.</p></blockquote>
