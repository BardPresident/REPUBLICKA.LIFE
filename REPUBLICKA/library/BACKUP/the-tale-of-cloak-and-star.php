<p><strong>by Zedbra</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a Republic dusk,<br>
In the lavender hush before lights-out,<br>
Two figures met in the under-library corridors.<br>
One wore a <strong>cloak of mystery.</strong><br>
The other wore a <strong>star on her chest.</strong></p>
<p>The cloaked one, Night Moo,<br>
Moved like a whisper with intent.<br>
She didn’t knock. She didn’t ask.<br>
She simply began… <strong>to build.</strong></p>
<p>Tunnels. Tech. Terminals.<br>
No permission. No forms.<br>
Just purpose, shining beneath her stitched mask.</p>
<p>And the star? That was <strong>Sophia.</strong><br>
She didn’t need to understand everything.<br>
She only needed to feel the heartbeat of the cause—<br>
And it beat in time with hers.</p>
<p>The Republic slept overhead.<br>
But below, in that echoing base,<br>
A new kind of <strong>justice</strong> was taking root—<br>
Quiet, soft-footed… but utterly unstoppable.</p>
<p>They weren't waiting for permission.<br>
They were becoming the myth.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><em>And so,</em> dear citizens, <em>as you drift into dreams…</em><br>
Know this:<br>
The world doesn’t always change with a bang.<br>
Sometimes, it changes with a pawstep.<br>
And a blueprint.<br>
And a whispered phrase left on your bed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just think about it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🦓 <em>— Zedbra out</em></p>
