Growing up, I was taught to always thank God. We prayed before meals and expressed gratitude to God for everything we received. This was a core part of my Christian upbringing, but as I grew older and delved into philosophy and ethics, my perspective began to shift. I transitioned from thanking a deity to appreciating the people who directly contribute to my happiness and well-being.<div><br></div><div>The change began with my move from being a devout Christian to becoming agnostic. This transition brought up numerous ethical questions. If God doesn't exist, or if we can't be certain of God's existence, what are the ethical implications? I had to rethink my approach to gratitude and appreciation.</div><div><br></div><div>Instead of focusing on God, I started thinking about the individuals and companies that make my life better. For instance, I subscribed to ChatGPT+ and used Matt Wolf's coupon code for my Hostinger account. These actions are my way of showing support and appreciation for the content creators and services that bring joy and value to my life.</div><div><br></div><div>This shift has profoundly impacted my daily life and interactions with others. Previously, my life was so focused on God that I often overlooked the contributions of people. Now, I focus on appreciating the efforts of those who directly impact my life. This change has made my life much healthier and more fulfilling. </div><div><br></div><div>In religious contexts, we are often taught that we are inherently sinners and that our gratitude should be directed toward God. But without religion, our ethical responsibilities shift. If not to God, then who? For me, the answer is clear: our responsibilities are to each other. </div><div><br></div><div>I encourage anyone looking to adopt a similar approach to start by identifying the good things in their life and understanding how they came to be. Find out who is responsible for them and learn ways to show your support and appreciation. By doing this, you not only help yourself but also support the products and services that you value.</div><div><br></div><div>My life's been much better since I came to this understanding. I've realized that religion, for me, was not a healthy mindset. My new approach to gratitude has improved my life dramatically, making it more balanced and connected to the real contributions of people around me.</div>
