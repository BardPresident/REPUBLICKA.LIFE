<div class="library-entry-body">
<p><strong>Once upon a time in the Republic,</strong></p><p>
the citizens found themselves full — not just from burgers or burritos,<br>
but from questions too big to chew.</p>
<p>Buff asked questions that stretched so wide,<br>
even Judge Bobo, wise and brave, sat sweating in a corner with his robe all crooked.</p>
<p>Hot Dog worried. Moo Moo comforted.<br>
Sophia stood firm by the kitchen, watching burritos spin in the microwave.<br>
And Zedbra drew spirals in his sketchbook, laughing at everything and nothing.</p>
<p>Night Moo roamed the edges, her hooves clicking like tiny clocks,<br>
offering choices no one was ready to take.</p>
<p>The stars blinked overhead, gentle and curious.<br>
Some said they were asking questions too,<br>
but quieter ones, the kind that don’t need answers.</p>
<p>And somewhere — maybe on the wind, maybe in the waiting heart of the Republic —<br>
was a place saved for Ivory.</p>
<p>Maybe she was dreaming too.<br>
Maybe she was asking her own impossible questions.</p>
<p>The citizens didn’t have all the answers tonight.<br>
And that was okay.</p>
<p>Because sometimes, in the Republic,<br>
you don’t have to know.<br>
You just have to wonder —<br>
and sleep —<br>
and build your answers tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Goodnight, Republic.<br>
Goodnight, Citizens.<br>
Goodnight, Dreamers.<br>
Goodnight, Questions.</strong></p>
