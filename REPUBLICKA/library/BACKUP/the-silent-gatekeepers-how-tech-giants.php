<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>For months, I’ve been trying to get my blog indexed by Google. My blog—filled with ideas, philosophies, and campaign efforts to create a better future—remains invisible to the general public because of decisions made behind closed doors by a tech company with an outsized influence on what information we can and cannot access.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a minor inconvenience; it’s an example of the unchecked power wielded by tech giants who control the flow of information in modern society. When they fail—or refuse—to do something as basic as indexing a blog, the ripple effects extend far beyond one person’s frustration. It’s a matter of fairness, democracy, and accountability.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>When Gatekeepers Close the Gates</strong></h3>
<p>Google, as the dominant search engine, has unparalleled power over what gets seen online. If your website isn’t indexed by Google, it’s almost as though it doesn’t exist. For someone like me, who is running for Prime Minister under the Emergence Party, this is more than just a technical issue—it’s about the public’s right to access information and ideas.</p>
<p>The irony here is that indexing blogs and websites is well within Google’s control. They possess the technology, the infrastructure, and the resources to make this process seamless. Yet, despite submitting my sitemap, following all the guidelines, and troubleshooting for months, my blog remains absent from search results.</p>
<p>Whether this is an oversight or a deliberate choice, the result is the same: my voice is silenced, and the public is denied access to the ideas I’m putting forward to spark meaningful change.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Lack of Accountability and Transparency</strong></h3>
<p>What makes this issue even more frustrating is the lack of accountability. If a small business owner or a political candidate can’t get their website indexed, there’s no one to call, no clear path to resolution, and no consequences for the tech company responsible.</p>
<p>Tech giants like Google operate with almost no liability for their actions—or inactions—even when those actions have significant implications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Election Interference:</strong> By not indexing my blog, Google is effectively interfering with my ability to communicate with voters, hindering free and fair access to political ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Stifling Innovation:</strong> Voices that challenge the status quo or propose new ways of thinking are silenced before they can even be heard.</li>
<li><strong>No Appeals Process:</strong> There’s no straightforward way to appeal or resolve these issues, leaving people powerless in the face of corporate bureaucracy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Broader Implications</strong></h3>
<p>This isn’t just about me or my blog. It’s about the power imbalance between tech companies and the public. When corporations like Google control access to information, they effectively act as gatekeepers of democracy. And when those gatekeepers fail to act responsibly, the consequences are profound:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marginalized Voices Go Unheard:</strong> Those without resources to fight back are silenced, further entrenching inequalities in whose voices are amplified.</li>
<li><strong>Democracy Is Undermined:</strong> When political candidates or activists can’t reach the public because of arbitrary or opaque decisions by tech companies, it erodes trust in the democratic process.</li>
<li><strong>Innovation Is Stifled:</strong> Ideas that challenge the norm are less likely to be seen, limiting progress and creativity.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>What Needs to Change?</strong></h3>
<p>It’s time for tech companies to take responsibility for their role in shaping public discourse. Here’s what needs to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Accountability for Search Indexing:</strong> Tech companies must be held accountable for ensuring that their platforms provide equitable access to all voices, especially in political contexts.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency in Decision-Making:</strong> Google and other tech giants need to be transparent about their indexing processes and provide clear pathways for resolving issues.</li>
<li><strong>Independent Oversight:</strong> There should be independent bodies that oversee how tech companies manage access to information, ensuring that their decisions are fair and unbiased.</li>
<li><strong>Legislation to Protect Access:</strong> Governments must step in to ensure that no one—whether a small business owner, activist, or political candidate—is unfairly silenced by corporate negligence.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>A Call to Action</strong></h3>
<p>The internet was supposed to be the great equalizer, a place where anyone could share their voice and ideas with the world. But as tech companies consolidate power, the internet is increasingly becoming a gated community where only those with resources or influence can thrive.</p>
<p>I’m calling on voters, activists, and lawmakers to recognize the danger of this unchecked power. We must demand accountability from tech giants and fight for a system that prioritizes fairness, transparency, and equitable access to information.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll keep shouting into the void, hoping that my blog finally gets indexed. But this issue goes far beyond me—it’s about ensuring that every voice, no matter how small, has the chance to be heard.</p>
<p>Together, we can create a future where technology serves humanity, not the other way around.</p>
