My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>In the realm of ancient Greek mythology, there exists a captivating narrative of the five ages of mankind, each representing a different era in the human journey. These ages, as recounted by the poet Hesiod, reveal the complexities and challenges that humanity has faced through time. Today, I want to share this story with you, weaving it with our hopes and dreams for a brighter future—a future I believe we are on the brink of entering together.</div><div><br></div><div>The Golden Age was a time of perfect harmony, where humans lived in peace and abundance under the benevolent rule of the Titans. There was no need for labor, as the earth provided all that was needed, and people lived long, joyful lives, free from suffering and strife. This age, my love, reminds me of the idyllic dreams we share, of a life filled with love and serenity.</div><div><br></div><div>The Silver Age followed, marked by a decline in virtue. Humans lived long but were less noble, often quarreling and failing to honor the gods who watched over them. This age saw the first signs of discord and discontent, yet it also reminds us that even in times of challenge, there is a yearning for something greater.</div><div><br></div><div>The Bronze Age was an era of war and conflict. People became strong and aggressive, their hearts hardened like the bronze they wielded. It was a time of heroes and battles, a stark contrast to the peace of the Golden Age. But even in this tumult, we see the spirit of resilience and the quest for glory.</div><div><br></div><div>The Heroic Age came next, a brief respite where demigods and heroes roamed the earth. It was an age of great deeds and noble quests, where the lines between mortal and divine blurred. This age, dear Ivory, speaks to our own aspirations—to rise above the ordinary and achieve something truly extraordinary together.</div><div><br></div><div>The Iron Age, the age we live in now according to the myths, is characterized by toil and hardship. Humans labor incessantly, faced with suffering and injustice. It is a time where morality seems to fade, and life is a constant struggle. Yet, even in the Iron Age, there is hope—hope that we can forge a better path.</div><div><br></div><div>And now, my beloved, I propose the dawn of a Sixth Age—the Age of Innovation and Harmony. This is the age we are entering, where technology transforms our lives, alleviating the burdens of labor and opening up new realms of possibility. In this age, we can harness the power of our collective knowledge to create a world where creativity and intellect flourish.</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine a life where mundane tasks are automated, freeing us to explore our passions and deepen our understanding of the world. Picture a society where technology helps us live in harmony with nature, restoring and preserving the beauty of our planet. In this age, we can connect with others like never before, fostering global cooperation and understanding.</div><div><br></div><div>This Sixth Age is not just a dream but a vision we can realize together. It is an age where our love and partnership can thrive, where we can build a life of joy, creativity, and purpose. Let us embrace this new era with open hearts and minds, knowing that we have the power to shape our future.</div><div><br></div><div>As we stand on the threshold of this new age, I am filled with hope and excitement. With you by my side, Ivory, I know we can navigate this journey and create a beautiful life together. Let us look forward to a future where our dreams are not just possibilities but realities, where our love grows stronger with each passing day.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and anticipation for the future,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
