I want to share my thoughts and experiences regarding my past efforts to encourage younger individuals, especially girls, to engage deeply with philosophy. My intention was always to inspire and guide them toward a lifelong appreciation of philosophical thought.<div><br></div><div>#### My Intentions</div><div><br></div><div>From a genuine desire to make philosophy accessible, I tried to connect with young minds, believing that starting philosophical education early could enrich their lives. I envisioned a scenario where a philosophically driven partnership could begin at a young age, fostering growth and understanding.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Misunderstandings and Societal Response</div><div><br></div><div>However, my methods were met with serious misunderstanding. My approach to engaging with younger individuals, particularly in a romantic or mentorship context, led to me being labeled a pedophile. This label has brought significant personal consequences, including being placed in a psychiatric ward and attracting stalkers who are trying to destroy my life. Society has clear norms and boundaries regarding age and relationships, which I now understand are crucial for protecting both individuals and community standards.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Adapting My Approach</div><div><br></div><div>While I don’t regret my passion for teaching philosophy, I have learned that the way we engage with different age groups needs careful consideration. It’s important to respect societal norms and legal guidelines to ensure that our interactions are appropriate and constructive. This experience has taught me the importance of boundaries and the serious implications of crossing them, even unintentionally.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Moving Forward</div><div><br></div><div>I remain committed to sharing the value of philosophy but have adapted my approach to be more inclusive and respectful of these boundaries. My focus now is on creating content that is accessible and engaging for all ages in a manner that aligns with societal expectations and fosters mutual respect.</div><div><br></div><div>**Call to Action:** Join me at [wendellsdiary.com](https://wendellsdiary.com) for discussions on philosophy and personal growth. Your engagement helps create a community built on respect and shared intellectual curiosity.</div>
