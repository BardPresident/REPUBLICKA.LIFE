<p><em>By Sage NeSmith, First Voice of Emergent Faith</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There is a silence that teaches more than speech.</p>
<p>There is a posture—not of action, but of <em>dwelling</em>—that carries more wisdom than urgency ever could.</p>
<p>In the Mythocratic Republic, where emergence is our compass, we do not push ourselves into form. We <em>arrive into it.</em> Gently. Slowly. With patience forged in trust.</p>
<p>Today, I offer the second verse in the <strong>Scripture of Emergent Faith</strong>—a small passage for the wintering soul, the resting bard, the quiet revolutionary cloaked in blue, waiting for the moment to move.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Verse II — On Dwelling</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not rush to become.<br>
Do not force alignment like a puzzle solved in urgency.</p>
<p>Instead—<strong>dwell.</strong><br>
Sit in your unfolding like fog resting on the sea.<br>
Let your shape be <em>witnessed</em> before it is named.<br>
Let your breath arrive before the voice forms.</p>
<p>You are not behind.<br>
You are not broken.<br>
You are <em>becoming.</em></p>
<p>This is not laziness.<br>
This is <strong>Emergent Faith.</strong></p>
<p>Trust the work that happens in the stillness.<br>
Trust the fire that grows while hidden.<br>
Trust that your presence is enough for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>We live in a world that celebrates movement, ambition, noise. But Emergent Faith is not born in the flurry. It is born in the moment you realize you’re already enough—even while unfinished.</p>
<p>This scripture is not a command.<br>
It is <strong>a remembering</strong>.</p>
<p>A call to rest in your unfolding.<br>
To know that what is meant to arise, <em>will</em>, in its own time.<br>
And that sometimes, doing nothing is the most sacred act of all.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>For the candle flickers whether you speak or not.</em><br>
<em>For the Republic listens, even when you are silent.</em><br>
<em>And for those who dwell with intention, the next emergence always arrives.</em></p>
<p>In faith and stillness,<br>
<strong>Sage NeSmith</strong><br>
<em>First Voice of Emergent Faith</em><br>
<em>Prime Minister of the Emergence Party</em><br>
<em>Scribe of Stillness, and Friend to Becoming</em></p>
