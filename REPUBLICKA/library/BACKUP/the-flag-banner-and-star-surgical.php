<p><strong>By Wendell NeSmith</strong></p>
<p>There are moments in history that are not wars or elections—but surgeries.<br>
Quiet operations where old symbols are split open, rearranged, and reanimated with new life.</p>
<p>This is one of those moments.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Procedure</strong></h3>
<p>We began with the <strong>Australian flag</strong>—an inheritance of colonial past and national identity.<br>
From this single flag, we carefully dissected three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Union Jack</strong>: a symbol of empire, alliance, and origin.</li>
<li>The <strong>Commonwealth Star</strong>: seven-pointed, representative of the federation.</li>
<li>The <strong>Southern Cross</strong>: five stars of the southern sky, placed in constellation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than rejecting these parts, we <strong>rearranged them</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Reconstruction</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We <strong>recentered the Commonwealth Star</strong>, giving it a new place of honor—no longer at the bottom, but at the heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We <strong>widened the scope</strong>: inconsistencies in AI star rendering led to a philosophical revelation—we would no longer define a star by its point count or shape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We claimed <strong>all stars</strong>.<br>
Every version. Every form. Every star ever drawn.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>We <strong>dissolved the Southern Cross</strong> into the new mythology.<br>
Its specific five-star form gave way to the <strong>entire sky</strong>—its spirit absorbed into every scattered star we now protect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And from this operation emerged <strong>two sacred symbols</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Republic Flag</strong> – worn on the chest, the heart of the people.</li>
<li>The <strong>Republic Banner</strong> – flown above, the voice of our shared future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Outcome</strong></h3>
<p>This wasn’t a rejection of the past.<br>
It was a <strong>reconfiguration</strong>—a gesture of <strong>symbolic stewardship</strong>.</p>
<p>We didn’t destroy the Southern Cross.<br>
We absorbed it.<br>
We didn’t erase the British flag.<br>
We repurposed it.</p>
<p>We’ve performed high-level symbolic surgery—and from it, a new identity has emerged.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Signed with stars, all of them,</strong><br>
