<div>A long time ago, Australia had a choice: Should we remain under the British monarchy, or should we become a republic—an independent nation free from the rule of the Crown? The people voted to stay under the Commonwealth, and the decision was made.</div><div><br></div><div>But times have changed. That vote was decades ago, and Australia is a vastly different country now. The world has moved forward, and so have we. Isn’t it time to revisit this conversation and give the people another chance to decide their future?</div><div><br></div><div>The 1999 Referendum: Why Australia Chose to Stay</div><div><br></div><div>In 1999, Australians were given a historic choice:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Remain under the British monarchy, with the Queen (now King) as our head of state.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Become a republic, with an Australian head of state chosen by the people.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The result? The people voted to remain under the Commonwealth. But the way the referendum was structured was flawed. The proposed model for a republic wasn’t a directly elected president but rather a system where Parliament would appoint the head of state. Many Australians who wanted a republic rejected the model they were offered, believing it wasn’t a real step toward democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>Essentially, the people weren’t voting against becoming a republic—they were voting against the version of the republic that was presented to them.</div><div><br></div><div>Why It’s Time for Another Vote</div><div><br></div><div>That referendum happened more than 20 years ago. Australia today is not the same country it was then. Our identity as a proud, independent nation has grown stronger, and our ties to the monarchy have weakened.</div><div><br></div><div>Here’s why we should hold another vote:</div><div><br></div><div>1. New Generations Deserve a Say</div><div><br></div><div>Many Australians who voted in 1999 are no longer with us, and a whole new generation has never had a say in this decision.</div><div><br></div><div>Young Australians have grown up in a world where monarchies feel outdated, and democracy is expected. They should have the right to decide their country’s future.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. The Monarchy No Longer Represents Us</div><div><br></div><div>Australia is a diverse, multicultural nation, yet we are still tied to a foreign royal family that has little connection to our daily lives.</div><div><br></div><div>The British monarchy is a symbol of colonial rule, and many Australians—especially Indigenous Australians—see it as a reminder of oppression rather than unity.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. A President Chosen by Australians, Not Born into Privilege</div><div><br></div><div>Why should our head of state be a king we never voted for, living in another country?</div><div><br></div><div>A republic means we get to choose our own leader, someone who truly represents our values, culture, and vision for the future.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. A Stronger, Independent Australia</div><div><br></div><div>Many modern nations have moved away from monarchy to become fully independent republics.</div><div><br></div><div>Australia already functions as an independent country, but our ties to the monarchy hold us back from truly stepping into our own identity on the world stage.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>What Kind of Republic Should We Become?</div><div><br></div><div>One of the biggest issues in 1999 was that Australians didn’t like the model of the republic that was proposed. If we hold another referendum, we need to make sure it’s a fair choice.</div><div><br></div><div>Some possible models include:</div><div><br></div><div>A directly elected president chosen by the people (like the USA or France).</div><div><br></div><div>A parliamentary-appointed head of state (similar to Ireland or Germany).</div><div><br></div><div>A hybrid model where both Parliament and the people have a say.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Whatever the model, the key point is giving Australians a real choice that reflects their values.</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party Supports a New Vote</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party believes in a democracy that evolves with the people. The 1999 vote was important, but it does not reflect the Australia of today.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that:</div><div>✅ Australians deserve the right to vote again on becoming a republic.</div><div>✅ The next referendum should offer multiple models, so people can choose the best system.</div><div>✅ Australia’s head of state should be chosen by Australians, not inherited from a foreign royal family.</div><div><br></div><div>A Call to Action</div><div><br></div><div>The conversation about Australia’s independence is far from over. If we truly believe in democracy, then we should be able to revisit major national decisions as the world changes.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s time to bring this issue back to the table and give Australians another chance to decide. Let’s talk about what kind of future we want—one where we stand on our own, with leaders we choose, representing a nation that is fully ours.</div><div><br></div><div>What do you think?
