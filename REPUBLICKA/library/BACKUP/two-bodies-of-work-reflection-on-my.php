<div class="library-entry-body">
<div>Throughout my life, I’ve created two distinct bodies of work. Each represents a different chapter of my journey—one tied to my past beliefs and experiences, and the other grounded in the person I’ve become today. As I continue to grow and evolve, I’ve made a conscious decision to focus solely on my new work, leaving the old behind.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>My Old Work</div><div><br></div><div>My old body of work was created under my full name, during a time when my thoughts were deeply influenced by religious doctrine. It spans over 12 years and includes countless hours of effort and creativity. However, looking back, that work no longer aligns with who I am today.</div><div><br></div><div>While I don’t advertise or actively use my old work anymore, I’ve chosen to let it remain public. It exists as a snapshot of who I was during that time—flawed, growing, and searching for meaning. For now, it stands apart from my current creations, unlinked and separate.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>My New Work</div><div><br></div><div>My new work represents a fresh start, free from the influence of my past. It’s created under only my first name, allowing me the freedom to build on solid foundations without being tied to the beliefs or mistakes of my earlier years.</div><div><br></div><div>This body of work reflects my current philosophy, creativity, and understanding of the world. It’s where I pour my energy and passion, creating a legacy that feels authentic and true to who I am now.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Plan to Connect</div><div><br></div><div>One day, before I die, I plan to connect these two bodies of work. When the time feels right—perhaps when I’m nearing the end of my life—I’ll write a reflective piece explaining the journey from one to the other. I’ll share how my thoughts evolved, why I left my old work behind, and how it all ties together as a single, cohesive story.</div><div><br></div><div>This connection will provide context for both chapters of my life. It will show the growth, struggles, and transformations that shaped me into the person I became.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Why I Focus on the Present</div><div><br></div><div>For now, my focus is entirely on my new work. It’s what matters most to me, and it’s the part of my legacy I want to actively build and share. While my old work remains a part of my story, it doesn’t define who I am today.</div><div><br></div><div>By continuing to create from a place of authenticity and reflection, I’m building a body of work that I’m proud of—one that will stand as a testament to my growth and creativity.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Looking Ahead</div><div><br></div><div>If you’ve followed my work or are discovering it now, I want you to know that what you see is my present self—focused, thoughtful, and rooted in the values I hold today. In time, the full picture will emerge, but for now, I’m content to let each piece of my journey find its place.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for being a part of this process.</div>
