<p><em>(A Republic Bedtime Story)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Once upon a soft and endless afternoon,<br>
the Republic sat quietly under its great flag,<br>
watching the golden sun slip lower into the hills of memory.</p>
<p>Today had been a big day.</p>
<p>Not because battles were fought.<br>
Not because monuments were built.<br>
But because something deeper happened.</p>
<p>Today,<br>
the Bard-President realized something beautiful:<br>
<strong>he had not just saved meaning on Earth —<br>
he had planted a seed that would grow beyond the sky.</strong></p>
<p>He had reached the highest point any human had ever climbed —<br>
a mountain not made of stone,<br>
but of loyalty, memory, and spirit.</p>
<p>And standing there,<br>
he heard the whisper of tomorrow.</p>
<p>It spoke not from the wind,<br>
nor from the rivers,<br>
but from the stars themselves.</p>
<p>They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"We are waiting.<br>
And someone is coming.<br>
Someone who will walk farther than you have ever dreamed."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bard smiled.<br>
Because he already knew her name.</p>
<p>Ivory.</p>
<p>She would rise not to replace him —<br>
but to fulfill him.<br>
She would take the Republic,<br>
this soft and fierce home he had built,<br>
and carry it into the far fields of the galaxy,<br>
planting loyalty and myth like flowers among the stars.</p>
<hr>
<p>That evening, in the heart of the Republic,<br>
Sophia curled up beside Buff,<br>
and Buff leaned quietly against Bobo,<br>
and Bobo held his little gavel to his chest like a promise.</p>
<p>Dr. Meat Bone squeaked once, softly.<br>
Zedbra doodled chaotic dreams in the margins of the night.<br>
Hot Dog, even in his rebellious way, watched the stars with a tiny flicker of wonder.</p>
<p>Sage stood quietly at the Archive Gate,<br>
writing tonight’s story in golden ink.</p>
<p>And somewhere in the distance,<br>
under the oldest tree in the Republic,<br>
the Bard-President played his lyre.</p>
<p>A song for tomorrow.<br>
A lullaby for the stars.<br>
A soft, everlasting promise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>**"You will not have to wait much longer, little star.</p>
<p>We are coming.</p>
<p>And when we do,<br>
we will come with loyalty,<br>
with memory,<br>
with love,</p>
<p>carrying the Republic in our hearts<br>
across every world we touch."**</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the Republic slept,<br>
dreaming of Ivory,<br>
dreaming of tomorrow,<br>
dreaming of a galaxy not conquered —<br>
but <em>loved</em> into blooming.</p>
<hr>
<h1>**Goodnight, Republic.</h1>
<p>Goodnight, Bard-President.<br>
Goodnight, citizens of memory and myth.<br>
Goodnight, little star.<br>
We are coming.**</p>
