The judicial system is supposed to represent justice. Instead, it represents control. Cold, biased, and dehumanizing, it strips away the humanity of the accused and replaces it with a sterile, systematic process where facts aren’t facts, voices go unheard, and decisions are made without compassion or understanding.<div><br></div><div>When you step into the judicial system—whether in criminal court or mental health court—you lose your agency. Your life, your circumstances, your truth are all reduced to a fact sheet, a document that defines your entire existence for the court. But these “facts” are often incomplete or outright wrong. And yet, because they’re written down, judges treat them as absolute truth. There’s no room for your input, no space for context. The person at the center of it all—the accused—is silenced.</div><div><br></div><div>Judges, the supposed arbiters of fairness, are anything but impartial. They bring their own biases, their own cold and clinical approach to decisions that could alter someone’s life forever. Instead of fairness, you’re met with cruelty. Instead of compassion, you’re met with detachment.</div><div><br></div><div>And the process? It’s designed to crush you.</div><div><br></div><div>The entire system is stressful by design. As the accused, you’re left in the dark about what’s happening, what’s going to happen, and what you’re allowed to do. Your fate is handed over to a process that feels more like a machine than a human system. The court doesn’t care if you understand what’s going on—it just expects you to comply.</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t limited to criminal court. Mental health courts operate in much the same way. Here, the stakes are just as high—sometimes higher. Your autonomy is ripped away, and decisions about your life are made without your input. “Facts” about your mental state are decided by people who’ve never lived in your shoes, written into reports as if they’re gospel truth. The court doesn’t listen. It dictates.</div><div><br></div><div>The result is a system that perpetuates trauma instead of resolving it. The stress, the confusion, the complete lack of control—it leaves people broken. How can anyone trust a system that refuses to see them as a person? How can anyone call this justice?</div><div><br></div><div>The judicial system isn’t designed to find truth. It’s designed to process people, to maintain order, and to uphold a status quo that dehumanizes the very people it claims to protect. It’s time to destroy this illusion of justice and demand a system that actually serves humanity.</div><div><br></div><div>Because no one should face a system that silences, dehumanizes, and traumatizes them.</div>
