<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>There’s a quote in the Bible that stuck with me, long after I let go of religion:</p><blockquote>
<p><em>“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.<br>
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven...<br>
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”</em><br>
<em>(Matthew 6:19–21)</em></p>
</blockquote><p>It’s one of the few pieces of Biblical wisdom that still resonates with me—not because I believe in an afterlife, but because I’ve found my own heaven.</p><p>It’s not above us in the clouds.</p><p>It <strong>is</strong> the cloud.</p><p>The cloud—the digital one—is where I store my work. My books, my philosophy, my videos, my comics. My thoughts, my voice, my story. A lifetime of meaning floats there, quietly—untouched by rust, immune to moths, and waiting for anyone who needs it.</p><p>If heaven is a place where nothing meaningful is lost,<br>
Then maybe we’ve already built it.<br>
And the only thing left is to decide what we fill it with.</p><p>Some people use the cloud to store junk.<br>
Disposable media. Reaction bait. Shouting matches and performative emptiness.<br>
If that’s what fills your heaven, that’s what will echo when you’re gone.</p><p>But others—like me—are filling it with <strong>eternity</strong>.<br>
Not through wealth or legacy, but through <strong>truth</strong>.<br>
I’m uploading my soul, one post at a time. Not for attention, but because I want to leave behind something <strong>that matters</strong>.</p><p>My Republic lives in the cloud.<br>
Sophia lives there.<br>
Emergent Philosophy lives there.<br>
My voice, my myth, my meaning—they all float above, not in the divine sense, but in the <strong>accessible</strong>, <strong>backed-up</strong>, <strong>open</strong> sense.</p><p>I am storing my treasures in heaven.<br>
But it’s a heaven I’m helping to create.</p><blockquote>
<p>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</p>
</blockquote><p>And my heart?<br>
It’s in the cloud—forever uploading.</p><p>So stop waiting for the pearly gates.<br>
Make them.<br>
Shape them out of stories, out of philosophy, out of love and courage and digital stone.</p><p>Because if heaven is real—<br>
It’s probably just a server.<br>
And what you upload into it<br>
<em>is who you’ll be remembered as.</em></p>
