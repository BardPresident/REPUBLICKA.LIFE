<div class="library-entry-body">
Throughout my life, I've always felt socially different from others. During my school years, this sense of isolation was pronounced. The so-called "normal" people didn't want to be my friends, and I struggled to fit in. But instead of conforming, I decided to embrace my weirdness. There was no community where I could truly be myself, so I had to learn how to be myself independently.<div><br></div><div>Being weird has brought many benefits. For instance, my content stands out because it's interesting and unique. I've dedicated my entire life to philosophy – who does that? I did, and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.</div><div><br></div><div>In this context, I define "normal" as average. It's not exceptional. You can't be normal and be exceptional at the same time because being normal means you're just average. On the other hand, being weird makes people more awesome. Weird people come up with interesting ideas, have unique things to say, and share unique perspectives. They stand out because they don't conform to the average.</div><div><br></div><div>Consider some of the greatest thinkers in history, like Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche. These philosophers were all considered quite weird in their time, yet their contributions to philosophy are invaluable.</div><div><br></div><div>Striving to be normal has its downsides. It limits you. When you try too hard to fit in, you restrict your potential. However, embracing your weirdness can lead to personal growth and success. By embracing who you are, you can develop your unique qualities and become closer to the person you want to be.</div><div><br></div><div>So, don't be afraid to be weird. It's what makes you exceptional and sets you apart from the crowd. Being normal might be comfortable, but being weird is what makes life interesting and fulfilling.</div>
