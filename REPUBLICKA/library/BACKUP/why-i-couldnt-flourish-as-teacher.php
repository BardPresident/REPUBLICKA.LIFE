Teaching has always been one of the noblest professions—an opportunity to guide, inspire, and nurture the minds of the next generation. I once dreamed of being a teacher, believing it would allow me to share my wisdom, help others grow, and shape the world in meaningful ways. But when I stepped into the classroom, I quickly realized the system didn’t align with what I envisioned teaching to be.<div><br></div><div>The Reality of Modern Teaching</div><div><br></div><div>In today’s education system, teaching often feels more like regurgitating than inspiring. Teachers are required to follow strict curricula, delivering content created by others without much room for personal insight or individuality. It’s a system designed for standardization, not creativity or wisdom.</div><div><br></div><div>For someone like me, who values critical thinking, authenticity, and the power of personal perspective, this was a fundamental mismatch. I couldn’t simply teach what I was told to teach, especially when much of it conflicted with my values and worldview.</div><div><br></div><div>The Struggle to Impart Wisdom</div><div><br></div><div>I wanted to be a teacher who encouraged students to think for themselves, to question, to explore, and to let their understanding emerge naturally. But the system had no room for that. Instead, it demanded conformity—both from students and teachers. There was no space to share my own thoughts, challenge the material, or guide students toward deeper understanding.</div><div><br></div><div>Teaching became a frustrating exercise in memorization, a process that felt devoid of meaning. I wasn’t teaching—I was delivering information, and it didn’t take long for me to realize I couldn’t thrive in that environment.</div><div><br></div><div>The Frustration of Insecurity</div><div><br></div><div>Walking away from teaching didn’t just mean abandoning a career—it meant giving up on what I thought could be my way of contributing meaningfully to society. And without another way to earn a living through my passions, I found myself in an incredibly frustrating position.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, I have to rely on government support and taxpayers to sustain myself. This reliance feels unfair—to me and to those who support me—because I’ve spent my life cultivating knowledge and wisdom that I believe should be enough to sustain me. I don’t want to be dependent; I want to stand on my own through the work I’ve done and the ideas I’ve shared.</div><div><br></div><div>A Broader Critique of the System</div><div><br></div><div>The education system is built on the assumption that knowledge is something to be transferred, not discovered. It prioritizes efficiency over creativity, testing over understanding, and compliance over curiosity. This approach stifles not only students but also teachers who want to do more than follow a script.</div><div><br></div><div>The result is an environment where real teaching—helping students uncover their potential, encouraging critical thought, and fostering a love for learning—gets lost.</div><div><br></div><div>What Teaching Should Be</div><div><br></div><div>Teaching, in its truest form, is about creating the conditions for growth. It’s not about providing answers but about sparking questions. It’s not about enforcing conformity but about celebrating individuality.</div><div><br></div><div>The Philosophy of Emergence aligns beautifully with this vision. It suggests that understanding and growth come naturally when the right conditions are in place. A good teacher doesn’t dictate or regurgitate—they guide, observe, and nurture, allowing students to discover their own truths.</div><div><br></div><div>Why I Walked Away</div><div><br></div><div>I didn’t leave teaching because I stopped believing in its value. I left because I couldn’t be the teacher I wanted to be within the system’s constraints. I couldn’t share my wisdom, challenge the status quo, or encourage students to think critically. And without those elements, teaching lost its meaning for me.</div><div><br></div><div>A Call for Change</div><div><br></div><div>If we want education to truly benefit students and society, we need to rethink what it means to teach. We need to create systems that empower teachers to share their wisdom, foster curiosity, and encourage critical thinking. We need to let teaching—and learning—emerge naturally, rather than forcing it into rigid molds.</div><div><br></div><div>Until then, many potential teachers like me will continue to walk away, unable to flourish in a system that values conformity over creativity. And the students will miss out on the wisdom we’re ready to share.</div>
