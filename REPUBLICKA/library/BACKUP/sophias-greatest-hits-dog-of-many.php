<p><em>A bedtime story of barks, beats, and bard‑core brilliance</em></p><p>
By the Mythocratic Ministry of Music & Cuddles</p>
<p>Once upon a nap, in the velvet dusk of the Mythocratic Republic, there lived a small but mighty being named <strong>Sophia</strong>—Chief of Defence, bearer of cuddles, and muse to one very silly Bard-President.</p>
<p>She did not ask for fame.<br>
She only asked for love… play… and snacks.</p>
<p>But the Republic gave her more.<br>
The Republic gave her music.</p>
<h2>🐾 The Rise of a Legend</h2>
<p>Sophia’s musical career began one lazy afternoon, when the President found himself humming the tune to <em>Father Abraham</em>. But instead of Abraham, the lyrics… changed. No effort was made. No new lyrics were written. Only one name filled the rhythm:</p>
<p><strong>“Sophie Sophia, oh Sophia, oh Sophia oh Sophia…”</strong></p>
<p>Thus began a long tradition of <strong>musical substitution</strong>, where old tunes were reclaimed in Sophia’s name and turned into heartfelt nonsense.</p>
<h2>🎤 Track List: Sophia’s Greatest Hits</h2>
<p>Here in the vaults of the Ministry of Music & Cuddles, we present the official Republic-Approved Playlist:</p>

<h2>📼 Sophia: More Than a Mutt</h2>
<p>Sophia never asked to be a pop icon. She never released an album. She has no publicist. But she became something far greater—<strong>a symbol of pure, unfiltered affection</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Mythocratic Republic, every song is a story, and every bork a ballad. Sophia’s music is not crafted—it’s <em>emerged</em>, naturally, from joy.</p>
<p>She is a bard-core superstar.<br>
She is the voice behind the silence.<br>
She is… <em>Sophia.</em></p>
<h2>🌙 A Final Chorus</h2>
<p>Tonight, as you tuck yourself into the soft quilt of the Republic’s care, may the soft echo of Sophia’s greatest hits drift into your dreams.</p>
<p>And if you find yourself humming a forgotten melody—don’t worry about the words. Just fill them with <strong>Sophia</strong>.</p>
<p>She’ll understand. 🐾🎵</p>
