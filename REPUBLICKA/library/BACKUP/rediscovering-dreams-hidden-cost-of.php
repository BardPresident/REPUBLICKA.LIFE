Since quitting marijuana, something amazing has returned to my life—something I hadn’t realized I was missing: my dreams. I had forgotten what it was like to dream, but now, every night, I find myself lost in vivid, long-lasting dreams. It's as if I’ve rediscovered a whole new part of life.<div><br></div><div>For years, I used to think marijuana was harmless. Sure, it relaxed me and helped me cope with stress, but what I didn’t realize was the cost it had on my sleep, specifically on my REM sleep. Marijuana significantly reduces the amount of REM sleep you get, the stage of sleep when most dreaming occurs. Without it, your brain doesn’t get the full chance to process the events of the day, leaving thoughts and emotions unorganized.</div><div><br></div><div>Since I quit smoking, my dreams have come back—every night. And it’s not just that I dream; my dreams are vivid, rich, and incredibly long. In fact, dreams seem to have their own time dilation, extending what feels like a few hours into a longer experience. In a way, it feels like my life is fuller now. My mind has a way to sort through my thoughts, and it feels like the dream state has extended my life in ways I never considered.</div><div><br></div><div>Health Implications of Dreaming</div><div><br></div><div>Dreams are more than just random images during sleep; they play a crucial role in mental health and well-being. REM sleep, where most dreaming occurs, is critical for emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and overall cognitive function. It’s a time when your brain sorts through the day’s events, processes emotions, and helps you mentally prepare for what’s next. Without it, life becomes a clutter of unresolved thoughts and emotions.</div><div><br></div><div>Since quitting marijuana, I feel sharper and more in tune with myself. Dreams offer not just rest but clarity. I’ve realized how important it is to experience this part of life every night. While I once thought marijuana was just fine, I’ve now seen how stopping REM sleep affected my ability to fully process day-to-day life.</div><div><br></div><div>Extending Life Through Dreams</div><div><br></div><div>There’s something profound about how long dreams feel, thanks to time dilation. In a dream, moments can stretch into what feels like hours or even longer, giving me a sense that I’m extending my life in those nighttime hours. Every night, I’m not just sleeping—I’m living another life, another adventure, another opportunity to experience and reflect.</div><div><br></div><div>Conclusion</div><div><br></div><div>Quitting marijuana has given me back my dreams—both literally and figuratively. I now realize that it wasn’t just a harmless habit; it was robbing me of one of the most important parts of being alive: the ability to dream. If you’ve forgotten what it’s like to dream, or if you’ve never really given it much thought, I encourage you to take a step back and reconsider how your habits might be affecting your mind and your life.</div><div><br></div><div>For me, this journey has been nothing short of eye-opening, and I’m grateful to have my dreams—and my mental clarity—back.</div><div><br></div><div>Discover more about my journey and how I integrate these insights into my music and mythology work on my website: https://wendellsdiary.com.
