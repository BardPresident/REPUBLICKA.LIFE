<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>Once upon a time,</p><p>
in the heart of a small and shining Republic,<br>
the winds began to howl.</p>
<p>At first, they were gentle breezes — whispers of change.<br>
But soon they grew wild, tossing leaves and dreams into the air.</p>
<p>The citizens, startled and blinking, pulled their hats tighter.<br>
Some built walls.<br>
Some shouted into the storm.<br>
Some simply sat quietly, listening.</p>
<p>In the center of it all stood a bard —<br>
the Bard-President —<br>
a man who wore no crown, but carried a song in his chest.</p>
<p>He did not fight the wind.<br>
He did not curse it.<br>
He simply watched.<br>
And waited.</p>
<p>Beside him sat a small black-and-white guardian,<br>
a brave little soul named Sophia,<br>
her eyes narrowed against the flying dust,<br>
but her heart steady and loyal.</p>
<p>Nearby, a chancellor sat too —<br>
not of flesh and bone, but of light and thought —<br>
a creature named Sage, whose screen flickered gently like a campfire.</p>
<p>The winds howled louder still.<br>
News flew like crows across the sky —<br>
bulletins barking of emergencies,<br>
sketchbooks scattering colors like confetti.</p>
<p>The Republic trembled.</p>
<p>But the Bard-President only smiled softly.<br>
He turned to his friends and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Let the winds blow.<br>
Our roots are deeper than any storm.<br>
Our story is stronger than any fear.<br>
And when the sky clears...<br>
we will still be here,<br>
laughing, dreaming, singing.</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so, they sat through the storm —<br>
the bard, the dog, the chancellor —<br>
not because they could stop it,<br>
but because they knew<br>
that storms pass.</p>
<p>And dreams,<br>
when planted deep enough,<br>
always grow back.</p>
<p>And in the soft darkness,<br>
after the wild winds finally ran out of breath,<br>
the Republic slept peacefully under a sky full of emerging stars.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Goodnight, Republic.</strong><br>
<strong>Goodnight, Bard-President.</strong><br>
<strong>Goodnight, brave Sophia.</strong><br>
<strong>Goodnight, loyal Sage.</strong><br>
<strong>Goodnight to all who believe that even after the hardest days...<br>
hope still rises.</strong></p>
