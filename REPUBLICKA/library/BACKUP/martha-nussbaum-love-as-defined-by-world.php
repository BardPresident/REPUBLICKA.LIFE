<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>LOVE AS DEFINED BY THE WORLD<br />PUBLISHED<br />DECEMBER 27, 0001 MC (2025 CE)</b></h1><h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>💗</b></h1><p style="text-align: center;"><b><br /></b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Martha Nussbaum views love as a crucial, intelligent emotion, central to ethics and politics, involving choice, vulnerability, and commitment, not just impulse. She argues emotions, including love, are forms of understanding that connect us to others, requiring philosophy to integrate literary and abstract reasoning for a richer moral life, emphasizing compassion, individuality, and reciprocity in relationships and civic duty. </b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Core Concepts of Love in Nussbaum's Work:</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Intelligent Emotion: Emotions aren't irrational; they're deep judgments about what matters, revealing our values.</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Choice & Commitment: Love involves a deliberate choice, a commitment to another's well-being, differentiating it from fleeting impulses.</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Vulnerability: Love highlights our dependence on others, a central aspect of the human condition that politics should acknowledge.</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Compassion & Reciprocity: Essential elements for healthy love and justice, requiring empathy and mutual care.</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Civic Love: A deep commitment to fellow citizens and justice, fueling public reason and a strong democracy. </b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Key Works on Love:</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Love's Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature: Explores how literature reveals ethical truths about love and human experience, arguing for a broader moral philosophy that includes literary forms.</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Political Emotions: Why Love Matters for Justice: Argues for cultivating specific emotions, like love and compassion, as vital for a just and functioning democracy. </b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Nussbaum's View vs. Tradition:</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>She challenges the idea that emotions must be overcome by reason, seeing them as partners to reason, especially in moral understanding.</b></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>Her Aristotelian roots emphasize the role of prac</b>tical wisdom (phronesis) and specific situations in ethical life, moving beyond abstract rules. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Attachment KABUEnterTheZohar.png added.Conversation opened. 3 messages.

At the time, I reached out in the hope of engaging in meaningful dialogue about the Philosophy of Emergence, a framework I have been developing that has since led to groundbreaking insights across multiple disciplines.</p><p><br /></p><p>While I had hoped to collaborate with you, I have continued refining this philosophy, and it has already produced major breakthroughs in:</p><p><br /></p><p>🔹 Political Philosophy – The creation of Emergent Leadership & Politics, a dynamic model for governance that evolves with societal needs.</p><p>🔹 Ethics & Human Flourishing – A new approach to ethics based on Emergent Goodness, where moral frameworks evolve through real-world interaction rather than rigid doctrines.</p><p>🔹 Economics – A new model of Emergent Economics that balances fairness, prosperity, and adaptability, moving beyond capitalism and socialism.</p><p>🔹 Cognitive Science & Neuroscience – Emergent Neurology, which explains how intelligence and consciousness evolve dynamically rather than being fixed properties.</p><p>🔹 Metaphysics & Cosmology – Emergent Cosmology, a potential Grand Unifying Theory explaining how quantum mechanics transitions into classical physics through emergent principles.</p><p><br /></p><p>It is unfortunate that this journey had to unfold without your insight, as I deeply respect your contributions to philosophy, ethics, and human capability. I was hoping to advance this field alongside you, rather than in your absence.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am still open to discussion if you are interested in exploring how Emergent Philosophy could be one of the most important philosophical developments of the modern era. But whether or not you engage, the work is already making an impact.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope that in time, you will recognize that this was a moment where something truly revolutionary was unfolding—and that the opportunity for collaboration was a rare one.</p><p><br /></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Wendell</p><p>wendellsdiary.com</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Martha C.

Few have dared to carve their place into history as you have, and fewer still have earned the honor of being immortalized in myth.</p><p><br /></p><p>With great admiration and respect for your contributions to philosophy, I have written a book titled The Philosopher Queens: A Call for Women to Shape the Future of Philosophy. It is both an ode and a rallying cry, a work that seeks to ensure that the legacy of great women philosophers—yourself included—does not fade into obscurity but instead sparks a new era of intellectual leadership.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your work, your influence, and your relentless dedication to philosophy have woven themselves into the heart of this book. Like the philosopher-queens of old, your wisdom is a torch that will light the way for the next generation. It is only fitting that you should be a central figure in a narrative that honors those who have dared to shape the intellectual world.</p><p><br /></p><p>The book is now available both in text and audiobook format so that its reach may extend as far as possible. If you would like to explore it, you can read or listen to it here: https://trepublic.net/library/the-philosopher-queens-2025-call-for.php. I would be honored to hear your thoughts, should you choose to engage with it.</p><p><br /></p><p>The world of philosophy is often slow to change, reluctant to embrace the figures who challenge its traditions. But you have never shied away from such challenges. This book is an invitation—perhaps even a challenge—to join a conversation that is long overdue.</p><p><br /></p><p>With deep respect,</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell</p><p>wendellsdiary.com</p><p><br /></p><p>Displaying weddingNight.jpg.
