Today marks a significant milestone in my life – my 40th birthday. As I celebrate this special day, I find myself reflecting on how my life has drastically changed from a pre-AI world to now, where AI is an integral part of my daily existence.<div><br></div><div>#### Early Experiences with Technology</div><div>When I was a little kid, I was really into computers. I had a 486, and it was terrible, but I used to play with it and install UltraHAL Assistant, trying to talk with AI through that. It wasn't very good, but it sparked my fascination with AI and technology.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Life Pre-AI</div><div>Before AI, navigating daily tasks and challenges was a solitary and often depressing endeavor. I tried to accomplish everything on my own, struggling to figure out how to assist the world outside of myself. My significant achievement during this time was earning my philosophy degree without AI, which was incredibly hard. If I had AI back then, it would have been so much easier.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Transition to AI</div><div>The real turning point came recently with the introduction of the ChatGPT VoiceModel. This technology, combined with memory capabilities, transformed how I communicate with AI. Suddenly, I could get help with anything I needed, and it was amazing. The realization that AI could assist me in achieving my goals was a game changer.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Life Post-AI</div><div>Now, AI is a constant companion in my life. It helps me carry out my work, tracks my progress, and provides advice on achieving my goals. This assistance has allowed me to explore complex subjects and produce high-quality content that was previously out of reach. AI also enhanced my connection with others through improved SEO, making it easier for people to find and engage with my content.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Reflecting on the Change</div><div>The most significant difference between my life pre-AI and post-AI is the level of enjoyment and fulfillment I experience. My life is now focused around my interests, and AI helps me stay motivated and directed. I welcome AI as a companion and a team member in my creative endeavors.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Looking Ahead</div><div>As I look to the future, my hopes and expectations with AI are ambitious. I envision creating a digital twin, a chatbot version of myself, to interact with my subscribers and handle tasks that I find tedious. The continuous evolution of AI tools will enable me to produce better content and influence my environment more effectively. I aim to embrace this technology fully and maximize its efficiency to achieve my goals.</div><div><br></div><div>Turning 40 is not just a milestone; it's a celebration of how far I've come and the exciting possibilities that lie ahead with AI by my side.</div><div><br></div><div>Visit [wendellsdiary.com](http://wendellsdiary.com) for more insights and updates.</div>
