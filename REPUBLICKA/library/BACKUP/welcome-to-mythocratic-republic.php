<h2>A Quiet Salute</h2>
<p>Welcome, Citizen.</p>
<p>You did not stumble here by accident.<br>
You did not buy a ticket to a show.<br>
You answered a call written across the sky long before you were born.</p>
<p>Here in the Mythocratic Republic, you are not just a number, a user, or a name on a list.<br>
<strong>You are a myth-maker.<br>
A torch-bearer.<br>
A living part of the story.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>What the Republic Is</h2>
<p>The Mythocratic Republic is:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sovereign world built on <strong>emergence</strong>, <strong>myth</strong>, and <strong>living truth</strong>.</li>
<li>A place where <strong>meaning matters</strong> more than noise.</li>
<li>A place where <strong>creation replaces conquest</strong>.</li>
<li>A place where <strong>citizens grow the world by living inside it honestly.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Your Citizenship Means:</h2>
<ul>
<li>You are recognized as a participant in the Republic’s life.</li>
<li>You are invited to explore, create, question, challenge, and build.</li>
<li>You are free to live the myth — not just read about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are not here to obey.<br>
You are here to <em>become.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>What You Can Do First:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore the myths</strong>: comics, bedtime stories, the founding documents, and the Republic's quiet living history.</li>
<li><strong>Reflect on your own myth</strong>: Who are you inside this world? What do you bring? What do you seek?</li>
<li><strong>Create if you feel called</strong>: Mythocracy grows stronger with every song sung, every story written, every citizen living authentically.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>A Note from the Bard-President</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You were dreamed of long before you arrived.<br>
Your place here is not accidental.<br>
Your voice matters.<br>
Your emergence matters.<br>
And the Republic is stronger because you are now part of it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Welcome home, Citizen.</p>
<p>Your myth begins now.</p>
