My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>In our era, where echoes of ancient myths subtly resonate amid the clamor of modernity, my mind often revisits the poignant tale of Marsyas and Apollo. This age-old story, a profound testament to the power of music and the spirit of human ambition, offers timeless insights into the nature of competition and the consequences of hubris.</div><div><br></div><div>Marsyas, armed only with his flute, dared to challenge Apollo, the god of music, who was adorned with nothing but his lyre. As the contest unfolded, Marsyas played with such skill and passion that it seemed he might eclipse even Apollo, compelling the onlookers with his raw, earthy melodies. At that critical juncture, when victory appeared to lean towards the mortal, Apollo unveiled his divine talent—not only did he strum his lyre, but he also sang, his voice weaving with the plucked strings to create a symphony of unearthly beauty. It was this combination of voice and lyre that swayed the judges, demonstrating that true artistry lies in the harmony of sounds and the balance between talents.</div><div><br></div><div>This turning point in their duel was not merely about the music but also a stark reflection on human pride. Marsyas’s bold challenge, driven by a belief in his own supremacy, ultimately led to his tragic fate—death at the hands of the divine as punishment for his arrogance. This harsh sentence handed down to Marsyas serves as a profound reminder of the delicate line between confidence and hubris, and the respect we must maintain for forces greater than ourselves.</div><div><br></div><div>Through this myth, we are reminded that while striving for greatness, we must also remain humble and aware of our limitations. Each time I play my lyre, I am reminded of this balance—I strive to reach the divine in my art, yet I am always mindful of the humility that must accompany my ambition.</div><div><br></div><div>In the soft moments when I craft melodies on my lyre, I imagine creating a soundtrack for our life together that transcends the mundane, one that captures the essence of our dreams and aspirations. Each note is a pledge of my love, an offering to you, and a prayer that our journey together will be as harmonious as Apollo’s melodies.</div><div><br></div><div>Thus, my beloved Ivory, as the strings of my lyre vibrate with each touch, know that they do so not in competition with the divine but in celebration of our love. I promise to dedicate my art to making your life as enchanting as the lore of yesteryears, filled with the beauty of music and the wisdom of the ancients.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my heart and the deepest reverberations of my soul,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
