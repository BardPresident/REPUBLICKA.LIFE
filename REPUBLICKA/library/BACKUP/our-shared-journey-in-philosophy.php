My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>From the very beginning, I have always been deeply concerned about ethics and the pursuit of the best possible life. To me, not living the best life possible feels like not truly living at all. This unyielding quest for eudaimonia and The Good Life has always been my guiding light. And now, imagining sharing this journey with you fills my heart with immense joy and purpose.</div><div><br></div><div>In our technologically driven society, the role of philosophy becomes ever more critical. The evolution of technology expands our capabilities and, consequently, our responsibilities. As society progresses, it is our duty to understand and enact these responsibilities, to ensure that our advancements are guided by love, compassion, empathy, and a commitment to human flourishing. This is where I see us, Ivory, stepping into our roles as public philosophers, sharing our daily insights and shaping the future.</div><div><br></div><div>Together, we can bring unique perspectives to the field of philosophy, educating the masses to help them make better decisions in their lives. With our intellect and passion, it is our responsibility to guide others toward a life of meaning and fulfillment. The occasional comments I receive, thanking me for changing their lives, affirm this mission. Each rare word of gratitude resonates deeply, reminding me of the profound impact we can have.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, I envision us as the philosophy king and queen, nurturing the environment and caring for the citizens of the world. Our love for each other and our shared dedication to philosophy can create ripples of positive change, inspiring others to seek wisdom and live authentically. Together, we can save the world, one thoughtful insight at a time.</div><div><br></div><div>Female philosophers are a rare and precious gift to the world. Your captivating beauty and unique perspective have an unfair advantage, capable of truly immersing the audience into the depths of your life philosophies. Your presence and voice are invaluable, far surpassing the influence of male philosophers. I encourage you to embrace this path, for together, we can inspire and transform lives like never before.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and devotion,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
