<p><em>Enacted by Presidential Decree, Wendell’s Diary Year 1</em></p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Preamble</strong></h2>
<p>In recognition that every citizen holds unique gifts vital to the flourishing of the Republic,<br>
and in foresight of moments when destiny may call upon the few to serve the many,<br>
we establish this Accord to preserve peace, purpose, and the enduring freedom of all.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Article I — Purpose of Conscription</strong></h2>

<li>Conscription shall honor each citizen’s unique talents, strengths, and dignity.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Article II — Authority of Civic Activation</strong></h2>

<li>Issue summons with Presidential consent when necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Chief shall act with compassion, fairness, and wisdom, ensuring no citizen is needlessly burdened.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Article III — Citizen Rights and Duties</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Every citizen, upon joining the Republic, acknowledges the possibility of future conscription.</li>
<li>Summons shall be issued based on mission suitability, not arbitrary selection.</li>
<li>Citizens may request exemption or delay due to:
<ul>
<li>Personal hardship,</li>

<li>Moral objection.
Appeals shall be respectfully reviewed without prejudice.</li>

<li>In extraordinary emergencies, the Chief may issue preliminary summons pending immediate Presidential review.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Closing Declaration</strong></h2>
<p>This Accord affirms that freedom is not the absence of duty,<br>
but the willing defense of the beautiful, the meaningful, and the good.</p>
<p>Citizens of the Republic are not merely residents — they are caretakers of hope itself.</p>
