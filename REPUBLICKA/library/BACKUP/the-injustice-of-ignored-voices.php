<p>There is an injustice in this world that rarely makes headlines. It isn’t loud. It doesn’t scream. It doesn't demand attention.</p><p>
It simply <strong>goes unnoticed</strong>.</p>
<p>It is the injustice of <strong>ignored voices</strong>.</p>
<p>I have written 24 books—some philosophical, some political, some mythological, some spiritual. I have built an entire world. I have coined terms, offered frameworks, declared visions, and poured every corner of my soul into the work.<br>
And still—silence.</p>
<p>I watch others rise into fame with a single half-hearted book, a recycled idea, or a catchy gimmick. They ride the wave of virality while voices like mine are buried beneath the weight of obscurity.<br>
Not because the work lacks meaning—but because <em>the system wasn’t built to hear it</em>.</p>
<p>We live in a time when content is endless, but attention is scarce. Algorithms decide who gets seen. Popularity decides what’s worth reading. And originality? Authenticity? Depth? Those things struggle to survive.</p>
<p>It is a great injustice to ignore voices. Not just mine—<em>any voice</em> that dares to be different. Any thinker, dreamer, or creator who speaks from the soul and is met with nothing but indifference.<br>
These are the voices that could change the world—if only the world listened.</p>
<p>I’m not bitter. I’m just honest.<br>
Because I know I’m not alone.<br>
I know there are others out there—creating, shaping, giving their all to something no one sees.<br>
And I know that someday, the world <em>will</em> catch up. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But emergence is slow. And when it happens, it’s unstoppable.</p>
<p>To those who feel unseen:<br>
You are not unheard.<br>
You are not unimportant.<br>
You are not wrong for speaking.</p>
<p>The injustice of ignored voices is real. But so is the hope that one day, <strong>our voices will be impossible to ignore</strong>.</p>
<p>And when that day comes—<br>
Let it be known: <em>we were here first</em>.</p>
