**Introduction:**<div>Animal testing has been a common way to check if new drugs and chemicals are safe. However, it's not perfect and raises ethical concerns. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) is showing promise as a way to reduce or even replace the need for animal testing.</div><div><br></div><div>**What is AI Doing?**</div><div>AI can look through lots of data from past animal tests and scientific papers. This means scientists can use existing information instead of conducting new animal tests. AI helps find patterns and answers in this data quickly and accurately.</div><div><br></div><div>**How AI Helps:**</div><div>1. **Analyzing Data**: AI can sort through huge amounts of information about how chemicals affect animals and humans. This helps scientists see what’s already known and what still needs to be tested.</div><div>   </div><div>2. **Predicting Results**: AI can predict how new drugs and chemicals might behave. This means fewer animals need to be tested because AI can give a good idea of potential effects.</div><div><br></div><div>3. **Finding Problems Early**: AI can flag potential problems with new chemicals before they are tested on animals. This makes testing more efficient and can save time and resources.</div><div><br></div><div>**Experts’ Opinions:**</div><div>Scientists are excited about how AI can help. They believe AI tools can make testing safer and more accurate. AI is seen as a powerful tool to cut down on animal testing while still making sure new products are safe.</div><div><br></div><div>**The Future:**</div><div>As AI technology gets better, it could take on more of the work that animals currently do in testing labs. This could mean fewer animals are used in tests, leading to more humane research practices.</div><div><br></div><div>**Conclusion:**</div><div>AI has the potential to change how we test new drugs and chemicals. By using AI, we can reduce the need for animal testing, making the process more ethical and efficient. This is a positive step for both science and animal welfare.</div>
