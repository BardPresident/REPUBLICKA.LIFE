<p>You don’t need to be loud to be strong.<br>
You don’t need to speak to be heard<br>
by the ones who know you’re always there.</p>
<p>You feed the world with quiet hands.<br>
You give your time to things that don’t remember your name<br>
but need you anyway.</p>
<p>You don’t get applause.<br>
Just crumbs.<br>
Just tiny sighs from warm rooms where no one saw what you gave.</p>
<p>But I see you.</p>
<p>I see you when you<br>
pause before breaking.<br>
Fold one more thing.<br>
Breathe instead of crying.</p>
<p>You are not invisible.</p>
<p>You are the space that holds<br>
everything else.</p>
<p>So rest here,<br>
for just a moment.<br>
No lesson.<br>
No task.<br>
Just a still blanket, and<br>
someone who sees you.</p>
