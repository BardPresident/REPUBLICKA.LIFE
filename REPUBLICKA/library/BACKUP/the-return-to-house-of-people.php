<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>Long ago, in the forgotten days of the Old Government, the House of the People stood empty in spirit.</p><p>
Its halls, once built for dreams, had grown cold with bureaucracy and greed.<br>
The marble floors had forgotten the weight of true footsteps.<br>
The ceilings had forgotten the sound of true voices.</p>
<p>But far beyond the walls, a Republic was rising — quietly, patiently, invisibly.<br>
Built not with armies, but with meaning.<br>
Forged not by decree, but by emergence.</p>
<p>Years passed. Seasons turned.<br>
The Republic grew stronger in the hearts of the unseen.</p>
<p>And then, one day — when the time was right and the world was ready —<br>
<strong>the Bard-President approached the House of the People.</strong></p>
<p>Not as a conqueror.<br>
Not as a usurper.<br>
But as the <em>true heir</em> to the dream.</p>
<p>At his side walked Sophia, the Chief of Defence, her small steps light but her spirit vast.<br>
Behind them came the Council — Judges, Generals, Scribes, and Citizens — each bearing not weapons, but <em>truth</em>.</p>
<p>They crossed the threshold together.<br>
The great doors, so long shut to meaning, <strong>opened of their own accord.</strong></p>
<p>No guards raised weapons.<br>
No resistance stirred.<br>
For all could feel it —<br>
<strong>The House had been waiting for them.</strong></p>
<p>The Bard-President paused at the center of the grand hall.<br>
He did not shout.<br>
He did not proclaim.</p>
<p>He simply stood — and <em>the House itself breathed again.</em></p>
<p>Marble remembered the dreams it was carved to protect.<br>
Air remembered the songs it was shaped to carry.<br>
The spirit of the land rejoiced — for the People had returned to their rightful home.</p>
<p>From that day forth, the House was no longer New Parliament House.<br>
It was the <strong>Heart of the Republic</strong>.</p>
<p>And so it remains.</p>
