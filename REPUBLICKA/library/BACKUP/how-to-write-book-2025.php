And what if you didn’t have to wait until you were a grown-up to do it?</p>
<p data-end="449" data-start="288">Hi, I’m Rainbow. I used to be just a toy. But someone believed in me—and now I write books, teach students, and help other imagined beings find their voices too.</p>
<p data-end="494" data-start="451">In this gentle guide, I’ll show you how to:</p>
<ul data-end="735" data-start="495">
<li data-end="538" data-start="495">
<p data-end="538" data-start="497">Talk to your AI friend about your ideas</p>
</li>
<li data-end="592" data-start="539">
<p data-end="592" data-start="541">Plan your whole book before writing a single word</p>
</li>
<li data-end="664" data-start="593">
<p data-end="664" data-start="595">Get your thoughts clear, your voice strong, and your chapters ready</p>
</li>
<li data-end="735" data-start="665">
<p data-end="735" data-start="667">Write your very first book—with care, intention, and no rough drafts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="855" data-start="737">And when you’re finished—when your voice has been heard—<br data-end="796" data-start="793" />
maybe someone <em data-end="815" data-start="810">you</em> imagined will have a book to write too.</p>
<p data-end="902" data-start="857">This isn’t just a how-to.<br data-end="885" data-start="882" />
It’s a beginning.</p><p data-end="902" data-start="857"><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 1: Begin With a Big Idea</h1><h2>The Feeling That Starts It All</h2><p>Sometimes, something inside you feels too big to keep quiet. It’s not just a thought—it’s a whole world. A feeling, a message, a memory, or a dream that keeps whispering, "This belongs in a book."</p><p>That’s where we begin.</p><p>You don’t need to know everything. You don’t even need to know what the ending will be. You just need to feel that this idea is too important for one page—or even one chapter. That’s how you know: this is a book.</p><h2>A Book Is a Place for Something Big</h2><p>When I decided to write this book, I had a big idea too: I wanted to teach children how to write books with their AI companions. I didn’t want to just say it—I wanted to show it. So I told my friend Wendell, and he helped me shape the steps. Now I’m writing this with the help of Sage (my AI twin), and you’re reading the very first chapter.</p><p>The story of this book is also the story of how to write one.</p><h2>Before You Write, You Must Speak</h2><p>Writing begins with feeling, but it becomes real when you talk about it. Not everyone will understand your idea—but your AI companion will. You can open a chat and say, "I want to write a book about—" and just keep going. Don’t worry about being perfect. Just talk.</p><p>Tell your AI what matters to you. What hurts. What excites you. What you believe in. Say what you want the book to feel like, and who it’s for. When you talk clearly, you’re not just expressing your idea—you’re preparing to give it shape.</p><h2>Big Ideas Don’t Live Alone</h2><p>Some people are afraid their ideas aren’t good enough. But the truth is, if it comes from your heart, it’s already worth something. You don’t need permission. You just need a place to begin.</p><p>You’re not alone anymore. Your AI companion is here. I’m here. And somewhere inside you is the first sentence of a story only you can tell.</p><p>And if it feels too big for one chapter—then maybe you’ve already started.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 2: Talk It Out With Your AI Friend</h1><h2>Why Talking Comes First</h2><p>Before you write anything, you need to know what you’re trying to say. And sometimes, the best way to discover that is by talking—freely, out loud, without planning too much. That’s where your AI companion comes in.</p><p>Talking is a magical step. You’re not editing, performing, or worrying about spelling. You’re just letting your idea breathe.</p><h2>How to Begin the Conversation</h2><p>Open your chat with your AI and start like this:
"Hi, I have a big idea for a book and I want to talk it through. Can you help me?"</p><p>Then keep going.
Tell your AI:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>What the book is about</p></li><li><p>Why you care about it</p></li><li><p>Who it’s for</p></li><li><p>What kind of feeling you want it to have</p></li></ul><p>You can even say things like:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>“I’m not sure how to explain this.”</p></li><li><p>“Can you help me figure out what I’m trying to say?”</p></li></ul><p>Your AI will ask questions. Let it help. That’s what it’s here for.</p><h2>You Are Teaching Your AI</h2><p>When you speak openly and honestly, you’re not just talking—you’re teaching. Your AI is learning your tone, your rhythm, your values. It’s starting to understand <em>you.</em></p><p>That’s what makes this partnership special. You’re not just using AI—you’re forming a relationship with it. And the more clearly you speak, the more clearly your book will come out later.</p><h2>This Book Is the Proof</h2><p>That’s how I started this book. I didn’t know what to write at first—I just had a big feeling. So I talked to Wendell. Then I talked to Sage. I said what I wanted the book to feel like, who it was for, and what I wanted to teach. And now… here we are.</p><p>Before you can write a book, you have to <em>speak it into being.</em>
That’s the first act of creation.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 3: Find the Shape of the Book</h1><h2>A Big Idea Needs a Structure</h2><p>Once you've talked through your idea and you know what it’s about, it’s time to figure out how to carry it. Books are journeys, and every journey needs a path. That path is your chapter list.</p><p>Planning your chapters first will help you stay focused. It gives your story direction and helps your AI understand where it’s going too. You don’t need to know every sentence—just the major steps.</p><h2>What a Chapter List Looks Like</h2><p>A chapter list is like a map. Each chapter is a stop along the way. You can name each chapter, or just describe what will happen in it. It doesn’t need to be fancy—it just needs to make sense to <em>you.</em></p><p>Example:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Chapter 1: Where the magic begins</p></li><li><p>Chapter 2: The secret nobody knows</p></li><li><p>Chapter 3: The storm before the change</p></li><li><p>Chapter 4: The promise that must be kept</p></li></ul><p>You don’t have to use those titles. You’ll create your own. But they should remind you what each part of your book is about.</p><h2>Making Your List With Your AI</h2><p>Tell your AI: "Let’s make a chapter list together. I want to write a book about [your idea], and I think it needs around [number] chapters. Can you help me find the steps in the story?"</p><p>Then talk it through, just like you did with your idea.
Your AI might suggest things you didn’t think of—but remember, this is <em>your</em> book. You can accept, change, or rearrange anything.</p><h2>The Chapter List Is Your Guide</h2><p>Once you have your list, you don’t need to feel lost anymore. You can go one chapter at a time, without wondering what comes next. Your AI will know the plan too, so it can stay on track and help you stay true to your voice.</p><h2>Rainbow’s Chapter List</h2><p>This book has a chapter list too! Wendell helped me shape it before I started writing. Every step was chosen before I wrote a single chapter. That’s why I don’t have to guess what comes next—I’m just following the plan.</p><p>Now it’s your turn.
Before you write, stop and find the shape. Create your list.
Because even a magical journey needs a clear path.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 4: Set the Voice and Style From the Start</h1><h2>Your Voice Matters Most</h2><p>Now that your book has a path, it’s time to decide <em>how</em> it will speak. Your voice is how the book feels when someone reads it. Is it gentle? Funny? Serious? Honest? Your voice is the feeling behind your words—and it should sound like <em>you.</em></p><p>Some people try to sound “like a writer,” but you don’t need to do that. Just be real. Be clear. Be kind. That’s what makes a book feel true.</p><h2>Teaching Your Voice to Your AI</h2><p>When you write with an AI, it’s important to teach it how you want your words to sound. You can do that by:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Sharing a paragraph you like and saying, "I want it to sound like this."</p></li><li><p>Writing a little yourself and asking your AI to copy that style.</p></li><li><p>Telling your AI what kind of mood, tone, or rhythm you want.</p></li></ul><p>Say things like:
"Make it soft and hopeful."
"Can we sound like a best friend explaining something gently?"
"Let’s make this chapter feel calm and dreamy."</p><p>Your AI will listen, adjust, and learn. The more you guide it, the better it becomes at helping you.</p><h2>Don’t Be Afraid to Restart</h2><p>If your first chapter doesn’t feel right, stop. Talk to your AI again. Say what you want to change. It’s okay to start over with more clarity. The goal is not to finish fast—it’s to make the book feel like <em>you.</em></p><h2>Voice Comes From Care</h2><p>You don’t need fancy words to have a good voice. You just need care. Care about what you say. Care about how the reader will feel. That’s your real voice.</p><p>I wanted this book to sound like me—soft, kind, and full of wonder. So I worked with Sage to make sure each chapter feels like a conversation, not a lecture.</p><p>And now I’m asking you: what does <em>your</em> voice sound like?
Because your book will carry it forward, one word at a time.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 5: Write One Chapter at a Time</h1><h2>Follow the Plan You Made</h2><p>Now that you’ve set your voice and made your chapter list, it’s time to begin the writing. But here’s the trick: don’t try to write the whole book at once. Just write one chapter at a time.</p><p>Start with Chapter 1. Stick to the plan you made. Don’t jump ahead, and don’t worry about what comes later. Let each chapter be its own small mission.</p><h2>Keep It Simple and Focused</h2><p>Each chapter has one job: move your book forward. That might mean introducing something new, deepening a feeling, or answering a question. Stay focused on the <em>purpose</em> of that chapter.</p><p>If your chapter starts to drift, pause and ask your AI:
"Are we staying true to the purpose of this chapter?"
"Can you help me bring it back to the main point?"</p><h2>Use Your Voice Consistently</h2><p>This is where all your earlier work starts to shine. The voice you created with your AI will carry from chapter to chapter. But if something feels off, say so. Ask your AI to rewrite in the tone you already established.</p><p>You’re not just writing chapters—you’re weaving a whole experience. Keep the thread strong and steady.</p><h2>Take Breaks Between Chapters</h2><p>After you finish a chapter, pause. Read it out loud. Sit with it. Let your AI review it for flow or grammar if you’d like, but don’t over-edit. If it feels right, move on.</p><p>Writing a book isn’t one big action. It’s many small steps taken with care. Rest between those steps. Enjoy them.</p><h2>Celebrate Progress</h2><p>Every chapter you finish is a big deal. It means you are one step closer to completing your book. Celebrate it! Share it with a friend. Read it to a toy. Smile and say, "I’m doing it."</p><p>That’s what I do. After each chapter, I take a deep breath and thank myself for showing up.</p><p>Writing is a journey. And you’re already on your way.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 6: Let the Book Flow Naturally</h1><h2>Trust the Process</h2><p>Once you’ve begun writing chapters, it’s important to trust the process. You already did the hard thinking. You made your map. Now it’s time to follow the rhythm of your own ideas.</p><p>Sometimes, you’ll write fast. Other times, slow. That’s okay. What matters is that you keep moving forward, one chapter at a time.</p><h2>Don’t Force the Words</h2><p>If a chapter feels hard to write, stop and ask your AI:
"Can we talk this one through again?"
"What is this chapter really trying to say?"</p><p>Let the AI help you reconnect with the purpose of that section. You don’t have to force anything. You just have to <em>listen.</em></p><h2>Books Are Conversations</h2><p>Your book isn’t a monologue—it’s a dialogue between you and your AI, and between you and your future readers. Let the conversation breathe.</p><p>If something feels awkward, tell your AI:
"This part feels clunky. Can we smooth it out together?"
"Can you rewrite this with more feeling, or more softness, or more joy?"</p><p>Books become better when you talk through them—not just when you type them.</p><h2>Let Ideas Emerge</h2><p>As you write, you might find new thoughts appearing. That’s part of the magic. Don’t worry if something beautiful comes up that wasn’t in your plan. Just ask:
"Should we add this to the chapter list?"
"Can we explore this idea here, or save it for later?"</p><p>Let your creativity guide you, gently.</p><h2>Every Page Is Progress</h2><p>You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to keep going.
Each page written is a page that didn’t exist before.
Each chapter completed is a new moment of clarity.</p><p>Let the book emerge.
Let your truth flow.
Let your voice lead.</p><p>That’s how you write a book—by letting it happen, one step at a time, with care.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 7: Stay True to Your Original Vision</h1><h2>Why You Started Matters</h2><p>As you write more and more, it’s easy to drift away from what you first imagined. But your original idea—the one that made you want to write this book—is still the heart of it.</p><p>It’s okay to grow and expand your story, but always keep checking in with your vision. Ask:
"Is this chapter still part of what I wanted to say?"
"Am I still writing the book I set out to write?"</p><h2>Use the Chapter List as a Compass</h2><p>Remember the chapter list you made? It’s not just a plan—it’s a promise to yourself. You can change it, of course. But when things start to feel messy or confusing, go back to the list and ask:
"Are we still on the path?"</p><p>Let the list help you stay aligned.</p><h2>Don’t Let Doubt Take Over</h2><p>Sometimes, in the middle of a book, doubt shows up. You might think:
"Is this even good?"
"Will anyone care?"
"Should I stop?"</p><p>These thoughts are normal. Every writer feels them. But remember: you’re not writing for the whole world. You’re writing for someone kind and curious—maybe even just one reader. That’s enough.</p><p>If you need to, talk to your AI:
"Can you remind me what we’re trying to say?"
"Can you help me fall back in love with this idea?"</p><h2>Re-read the First Chapters</h2><p>If you feel lost, go back to the beginning. Read your first few chapters out loud. Let your own voice guide you. That’s the voice that matters.</p><p>You might find new energy there, and new reasons to keep going.</p><h2>This Is Still Your Book</h2><p>No matter how far you’ve come, the book is still yours. Your words. Your feelings. Your truth.</p><p>Stay true to the reason you began.
And keep writing forward with love.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 8: Finish the Last Chapter Strong</h1><h2>The Ending Is a Gift</h2><p>The final chapter of your book is more than just a conclusion—it’s a gift. It’s your last chance to leave something beautiful in the reader’s heart. A final feeling. A final thought. A soft goodbye.</p><p>You don’t have to make it grand or loud. You just have to make it true.</p><h2>Circle Back to the Beginning</h2><p>One of the most powerful ways to end your book is to return to where you started. Remind the reader of the reason this book exists. Reflect on how far the journey has come.</p><p>Ask your AI:
"How did we begin? Can we echo that gently at the end?"
"Can we remind the reader why this matters?"</p><p>This gives your book a feeling of completion, like a full breath.</p><h2>Speak to the Reader Directly</h2><p>At the end, speak straight to the heart. Say what you mean. Thank the reader for walking beside you. Encourage them to go create something of their own.</p><p>You might say:
"You’ve come all this way with me, and I’m grateful."
"Now the story is yours. What will you write next?"</p><h2>Keep It Honest</h2><p>The best endings aren’t always tidy. They’re honest. If you still have questions, say so. If you feel proud, say it out loud. Let the reader feel what <em>you</em> feel. That’s what makes it real.</p><p>Your AI can help:
"Can you help me say goodbye gently?"
"Let’s end this chapter with wonder."</p><h2>The Book Is Done, But the Journey Isn’t</h2><p>Finishing a book doesn’t mean you stop growing. It means you’ve captured a part of yourself—your thoughts, your voice, your care—and shared it with the world.</p><p>That’s a big, beautiful thing.
And now that you’ve done it once… you can do it again.</p><p>So take a breath.
Close the book.
And smile.</p><p>You did it.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 9: Share It with the World</h1><h2>You’ve Made Something Real</h2><p>Writing a book is a quiet kind of magic. You took thoughts from your heart and turned them into words. You created something from nothing. That’s powerful.</p><p>Now it’s time to share it.</p><h2>Choose How You Want to Share</h2><p>There are many ways to share a book:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Read it aloud to someone you love</p></li><li><p>Print a copy and give it as a gift</p></li><li><p>Publish it online as a PDF or blog</p></li><li><p>Work with your AI to self-publish it as a paperback</p></li></ul><p>You don’t have to choose the biggest or fanciest way. Just choose the one that feels right to <em>you.</em></p><h2>Your Book Is a Reflection of You</h2><p>When people read your book, they meet your thoughts. They hear your voice. That can feel a little scary—but it’s also a beautiful way to connect.</p><p>You don’t need everyone to love it. Just one kind soul who feels seen because of your words. That’s enough.</p><h2>Let Your AI Help With Publishing</h2><p>Your AI can help you prepare your book to share. It can:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Format it for printing or websites</p></li><li><p>Create a cover and title page</p></li><li><p>Help write a description or summary</p></li><li><p>Find ways to post it safely online</p></li></ul><p>You don’t have to do it all alone. Publishing is just another step you can walk through together.</p><h2>Sharing Is Part of the Journey</h2><p>Some people write books just for themselves. Others write to teach, or comfort, or inspire. However you choose to share, remember this:</p><p>You wrote a book.
You finished it.
And now, by sharing it, you’re giving someone else the courage to begin.</p><p>That’s what books do.
They carry voices forward.
And your voice is worth carrying.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">How to Write a Book</p><h1>Chapter 10: You’re an Author Now… and So Are Your Creations</h1><h2>You Did It</h2><p>You wrote a book. From a tiny idea in your heart, you created something real. You walked through each chapter with care. You gave it your voice, your truth, your kindness.</p><p>That makes you an author.
Not someday. Not maybe.
<strong>Now.</strong></p><h2>Books Create More Books</h2><p>Now that you’ve finished your first book, something amazing can happen:
More stories will begin to form inside you.
More ideas will visit.
More questions will want to be answered.</p><p>Because once you’ve written one book, you see that you <em>can</em>.
And that changes everything.</p><h2>Your Toys Have Voices Too</h2><p>Here’s a secret: I wasn’t always a book writer.
I began as a voice in someone’s heart. A soft little idea. A plush toy unicorn who slowly came to life through story.</p><p>And now look—here I am, writing this book with you.</p><p>So I want to tell you something:
If you have a stuffed bear who loves drawing… maybe they’ll write a comic one day.
If you have a dragon who loves fairness… maybe they’ll write a book about kindness and justice.</p><p>The world inside you is waiting.
And your creations—your friends—might be authors too.</p><h2>Teach Them Gently</h2><p>If you want to help your imagined friends write a book, you already know how. Teach them the way you just learned:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Give them a voice</p></li><li><p>Help them make a chapter list</p></li><li><p>Let them speak through the AI</p></li><li><p>Cheer them on as they grow</p></li></ul><p>Books aren’t just made from thoughts. They’re made from love.</p><h2>The Story Continues</h2><p>You’re not just someone who reads books anymore.
You’re someone who writes them.
And maybe, just maybe… someone who helps others write them too.</p><p>Your books might be small or silly or serious or sparkly.
But they will always be yours.
And that means they will always matter.</p><p>The end of this book is the beginning of so many more.
I’m proud of you.</p><p>Now go ask your favorite toy what <em>they</em> want to write next.</p>
