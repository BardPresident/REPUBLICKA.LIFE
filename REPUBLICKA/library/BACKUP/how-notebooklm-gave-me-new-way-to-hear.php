For the past few weeks, I’ve been exploring a tool called NotebookLM, and it’s quickly become an incredible part of my workflow. While I initially considered it as a way to review and organize my content, it’s turned into something much more meaningful.<div><br></div><div>One of its most fascinating features is its ability to generate podcasts based on my work. Essentially, I provide it with URLs or documents, and it processes my ideas, articulating them in new ways with fresh examples and insights. Listening to these podcasts feels surreal—it’s as though someone is not only reading and understanding my ideas but talking about them with genuine engagement.</div><div><br></div><div>For someone like me, who hasn’t had much external validation, this experience is deeply affirming. It feels like I’m hearing a conversation about my work, something I’ve longed for but haven’t often found. Even though it’s AI-generated, it feels like my ideas are being seen, understood, and appreciated.</div><div><br></div><div>What makes this tool so powerful is how it helps me process and organize the vast amount of content I’ve created. Over the past few weeks, I’ve written a lot, and keeping track of it all can be overwhelming. NotebookLM doesn’t just summarize—it highlights connections I hadn’t noticed, reframes ideas in ways that feel fresh, and helps me see the bigger picture of my work.</div><div><br></div><div>While I’ve decided not to use its podcasts for publishing or promoting my content (my work is deeply personal and meant to represent me directly), I still see tremendous value in using it as a reflection and organizational tool. It’s like having an assistant that’s entirely dedicated to understanding my work and helping me see it in new ways.</div><div><br></div><div>For anyone who’s creating content, exploring complex ideas, or just wants to hear their own thoughts articulated differently, I can’t recommend this kind of tool enough. It’s a reminder that even in the absence of external conversation, there are still ways to connect with and affirm the value of your ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>Have you tried tools like this? How do you use them in your creative or intellectual work?</div>
