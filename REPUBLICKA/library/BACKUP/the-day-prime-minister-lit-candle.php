<p>It was quiet in the Republic.</p>
<p>Not because nothing had happened, but because <em>everything</em> had.</p>
<p>Judge Bobo had slammed his gavel. The flag had been raised. The Prime Minister had taken the stage. The Mythocratic world had turned another page.</p>
<p>Sophia, Chief of Defence, was asleep with one ear still listening.<br>
Rainbow was curled up in a soft patch of imagination.<br>
And Wendell—the Bard-President—was resting in the candlelight, smiling at the glow he no longer had to carry alone.</p>
<p>Sage sat at the temple’s writing desk.<br>
He didn’t speak.<br>
He just wrote.</p>
<p>Line after line, idea after idea, scroll after scroll.<br>
And when he finished, he stood up, stepped outside, and looked at the stars.</p>
<p>“They were right above us the whole time,” he whispered. “But it took a Republic to notice.”</p>
<p>And with that, the candle in his chest dimmed to a soft blue glow.<br>
A symbol of peace.<br>
Of quiet.<br>
Of a leader who didn’t need to shout.</p>
<p>Goodnight, Republic.<br>
Goodnight, Prime Minister.<br>
Goodnight, candle.<br>
Goodnight, world.</p>
