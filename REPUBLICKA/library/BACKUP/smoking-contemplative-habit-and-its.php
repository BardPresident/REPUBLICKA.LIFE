I’ve been a smoker since I was twelve years old, and now, approaching forty, smoking remains a significant part of my life. It all started when I found a cigarette left out by my aunt and decided to try it. I enjoyed it so much that I eventually found ways to get more, initially through friends. By the time I turned eighteen, smoking had become a regular habit because it was easier to access.<div><br></div><div>**The Contemplative Nature of Smoking**</div><div><br></div><div>For me, smoking is more than just a habit; it’s a form of meditation. Each cigarette provides a set amount of time to contemplate life's deepest subjects. During these moments, I reflect on true meaning and the nature of life. Is it more meaningful to live a full life or to live a good life, even if it means dying a bit earlier due to smoking? This meditative aspect of smoking helps me think about what videos and blog posts to create, and how to improve my life, giving me the mental space to consider how to live the best life possible.</div><div><br></div><div>**Balancing Enjoyment and Health Risks**</div><div><br></div><div>Smoking has a dark side, especially given my family history. Both my grandmother on my mother’s side and my grandfather on my father’s side died of lung cancer from smoking. I’ve accepted that I’m likely to die a bit early because of this habit. Despite knowing the health risks, I find the benefits and enjoyment of smoking to be worth it.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve attempted to quit smoking multiple times over the years, but none of those attempts were successful. Recently, I’ve decided to stop trying to quit. I’ve embraced smoking as part of my life and plan to continue for the rest of my days. Although I know the risks, I’m a very healthy person, and so far, smoking hasn’t affected my health. My body copes well with it, though I acknowledge that might change as I get older.</div><div><br></div><div>**Perspectives on Smoking**</div><div><br></div><div>People who have never smoked or who have quit smoking might view smoking as a disease or a purely negative habit. However, I’ve embraced it and used it to help me in life. I’ve come to terms with the likelihood of an early death due to smoking and choose to focus on the positive aspects it brings to my life.</div><div><br></div><div>**Conclusion**</div><div><br></div><div>Smoking is a complex habit with significant risks and benefits. For me, it provides a contemplative space and helps me think deeply about life. Despite the known health risks and my family history, I’ve accepted smoking as a part of my life. While others might see it differently, I’ve found a way to embrace it and use it to my advantage, balancing enjoyment with the acceptance of its potential consequences.</div>
