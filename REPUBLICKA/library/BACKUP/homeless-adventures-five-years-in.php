For five years, I lived in the wilderness, sleeping in a tent—not because I wanted to, but because I couldn’t afford housing. This wasn’t some grand adventure or a lifestyle choice. It was survival.<div><br></div><div>I wasn’t a drug addict. I wasn’t lazy. I wasn’t someone who "deserved" to be homeless—not that anyone does. I was just someone trying to live, trying to find help, trying to create a life for myself. But the truth is, nobody cared.</div><div><br></div><div>When you’re homeless, society looks at you like you’re invisible. You’re not a person anymore—you’re a problem. I spent years trying to find help, but every door I knocked on stayed shut. Housing was out of reach, support systems were inadequate, and the people around me turned away as if my situation wasn’t their problem.</div><div><br></div><div>Living in the wilderness came with its own set of challenges. I lived in the mountains, far from the city. Every day was a relentless cycle of walking up and down the mountain to collect supplies. Food and water were the priorities, and I had to carry everything back up the mountain to survive.</div><div><br></div><div>At first, I didn’t even have a tent. I slept on the ground, exposed to the elements, vulnerable in every sense of the word. Eventually, I was able to afford some basics—a tent and some covers—and create a small semblance of comfort. But even then, it was a harsh, isolating life.</div><div><br></div><div>The system that’s supposed to help people like me failed completely. Homeless shelters were not an option. They weren’t safe. Combining all the homeless people into one place creates a dangerous environment. Not everyone who’s homeless is struggling quietly—some are dealing with severe issues, and living alongside them becomes its own kind of risk. The system didn’t offer me a safe place to stay, only more danger and chaos.</div><div><br></div><div>And yet, while I was homeless, I didn’t give up on myself. I kept creating content, pouring my energy into something meaningful even when the world gave me nothing in return. But the reality is, I shouldn’t have had to do it alone. No one should.</div><div><br></div><div>This is the first step in tearing down a society that allows people to fall through the cracks. The world likes to pretend that homelessness is the fault of the individual, but that’s a lie. It’s the fault of a system that doesn’t care.</div><div><br></div><div>If society continues to ignore the homeless—people like me, who were doing everything they could to survive and still found no help—what does that say about us? What does it say about a world where 9 billion people coexist, yet loneliness and suffering go unnoticed?</div><div><br></div><div>This is just the beginning. In this series, I’ll expose the flaws, failures, and inhumanity of a society that rejects its own. It’s time to destroy the systems that create homelessness and rebuild something better—something compassionate, something that works.</div>
