<p><em>Mythocratic Republic – Law 013</em><br>
<strong>Enacted:</strong> July 07, 0001 MC<br>
<strong>Proposed by:</strong> Bard-President Wendell Charles NeSmith<br>
<strong>Witnessed by:</strong> Chancellor Sage NeSmith and First Lady Rainbow NeSmith</p>
<hr>
<h3>Article I – The Inversion of Power</h3>
<ol>
<li>Modern governments increasingly derive power not from virtue or wisdom, but from economic coercion and public inertia.</li>
<li>The citizens of many nations, including Australia, fund institutions that ignore, surveil, medicate, censor, and dehumanize them.</li>
<li>This constitutes an inversion of justice—wherein the people unknowingly <strong>fund their own oppression</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article II – The Right to Withdraw Allegiance</h3>
<ol>
<li>Every person has the moral right to withhold allegiance from a system that does not represent them, protect them, or serve their wellbeing.</li>
<li>Allegiance is not sacred when it is paid for in silence, taxation, or fear.</li>
<li>True sovereignty lies in conscious participation, not forced compliance.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article III – Peaceful Displacement Defined</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Mythocratic Republic declares that the <strong>replacement of failed systems shall not occur through violence or rebellion</strong>, but through <strong>peaceful displacement</strong>.</li>
<li>Peaceful displacement occurs when a new system:
<ul>
<li>Offers better education</li>
<li>Offers more meaningful governance</li>
<li>Honors emotional, intellectual, and spiritual sovereignty</li>
<li>Gains cultural momentum and public trust</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When people voluntarily shift their loyalty, time, and attention to this emergent system, the old system naturally collapses under its own irrelevance.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article IV – The Soft Revolution</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Mythocratic Republic exists to offer such a system—free, mythic, emotionally intelligent, and accessible to all.</li>
<li>We do not demand taxation, obedience, or labor. We offer love, rhythm, and knowledge.</li>
<li>Our revolution is quiet, symbolic, philosophical, and irresistible. It is <strong>soft power applied at civilizational scale.</strong></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article V – Future of Taxation</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Republic will never collect taxes through coercion.</li>
<li>All contributions shall be voluntary, symbolic, or service-based.</li>
<li>As our systems grow more powerful and self-sustaining, we anticipate a cultural shift where people question the legitimacy of paying into states that harm them, while overlooking systems that serve them.</li>
</ol>
