<div>I want to make one thing clear—I love Australia. I don’t want to tear everything down or change the country beyond recognition. Australia is already the greatest country in the world because it provides free healthcare, supports its disabled population, and gives people a level of freedom and quality of life that many other nations lack.</div><div><br></div><div>I’m proud to be Australian. I always have been.</div><div><br></div><div>But that doesn’t mean we should ignore the problems in our system. Right now, we have a government where:</div><div>🔴 Politicians aren’t held accountable for their actions.</div><div>🔴 There are no direct channels for the people to engage with leadership.</div><div>🔴 The system silences independent voices instead of listening to them.</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t want to change everything—I just want to fix what’s broken. I believe in pushing Australia in the right direction, not destroying what makes it great.</div><div><br></div><div>The People’s Presidency isn’t about tearing down Australia—it’s about building on its strengths and removing corruption, inefficiency, and oppression where they exist. We have a chance to create a government that truly serves the people, where leadership is transparent, accountable, and connected to the public.</div><div><br></div><div>I’m not here to oppose Australia—I’m here to protect it, improve it, and ensure that future generations inherit a system that works for them, not against them.</div><div><br></div><div>I love this country, and I will fight to make it the best version of itself.</div><div><br></div><div>💬 Do you agree that Australia needs improvements but is still a great country? Let’s talk about how we can push it in the right direction.</div><div><br></div><div>🔗 wendellsdiary.com</div>
