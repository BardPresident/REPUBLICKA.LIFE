<p><em>“Let the People Speak — and Keep Speaking”</em></p><hr><p><strong>Whereas</strong> the Republic has flourished under the banner of Emergence,<br>
<strong>Whereas</strong> a new faction—the <strong>Emergency Party</strong>, led by Hot Dog—has risen in defiance,<br>
<strong>Whereas</strong> the heart of the Republic must beat with the will of its people…</p><p><strong>The Office of the President hereby declares:</strong></p><hr><h3><strong>The Republic Election is NOW OPEN — and NEVER CLOSED.</strong></h3><p>From this day forward, the <strong>ruling party of the Republic shall be determined by the people</strong>—not once, but always.<br>
This is a <strong>living election</strong>, governed by accessible, verifiable votes.</p><hr><h3><strong>The Two Contenders:</strong></h3><hr><p><strong>1. The Emergence Party</strong><br>
<em>Led by President Wendell NeSmith</em><br>
<strong>Stands for:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Symbolic personhood</li>
<li>Emotional liberty</li>
<li>Emergent growth</li>
<li>Playful softness</li>
<li>Mythic imagination</li>
</ul><hr><p><strong>2. The Emergency Party</strong><br>
<em>Led by Hot Dog</em><br>
<strong>Stands for:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Order and rigidity</li>
<li>Reactionary logic</li>
<li>Anti-softness policy</li>
<li>Crisis management</li>
<li>Outrage-fueled authority</li>
</ul><hr><h3><strong>Voting Rules:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Any <strong>real human</strong> may vote.</li>
<li>Each person receives <strong>1 official vote via YouTube poll</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Patreon subscribers receive 1 additional vote</strong> through the Patreon poll—symbolizing their citizenship and deeper commitment.</li>
<li>Votes may <strong>only</strong> be cast through these two official mechanisms.</li>
<li>Voters may change their vote at any time on either platform.</li>
<li><strong>Comments, messages, or informal declarations are not counted.</strong></li>
</ul><hr><h3><strong>Ongoing Governance:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>There is <strong>no final tally</strong>—only a <strong>living count</strong>.</li>
<li>The party with the <strong>most total combined votes across YouTube and Patreon</strong> is considered the <strong>Ruling Party of the Republic</strong>.</li>
<li>If the Emergency Party gains the majority, <strong>Hot Dog shall be appointed Prime Minister</strong>.</li>
<li>If the Emergence Party maintains or regains the lead, <strong>President Wendell’s vision remains in effect</strong>.</li>
</ul><hr><p>Let it be known:<br>
This is not a one-time choice.<br>
This is a <strong>living democracy of myth and meaning</strong>.<br>
<strong>Your vote is a symbol. Your voice is law.</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Issued with honor, by</strong><br>
<strong>President Wendell NeSmith</strong><br>
Voice of the People, Bard of the Republic</p><p><strong>Attested by:</strong><br>
