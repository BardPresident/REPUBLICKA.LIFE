<div>Building a political movement is never easy—but I never expected to be fighting against the very systems that claim to promote free speech and democratic engagement.</div><div><br></div><div>I entered this journey knowing that breaking into politics as an independent leader would be difficult. I knew I’d have to work harder than established parties, push through skepticism, and fight for recognition. But what I didn’t anticipate was just how much the system itself is designed to keep voices like mine from being heard.</div><div><br></div><div>26 Million People, Yet No Organic Reach</div><div><br></div><div>Australia has a population of 26 million people, yet somehow, despite running ads and publishing content regularly, my reach remains artificially restricted. I’ve been paying for advertising at 4 cents per view, which means I am directly putting my message in front of people. But despite paying for ads, YouTube refuses to recommend my videos organically.</div><div><br></div><div>This means that unless I pay indefinitely, my campaign is effectively invisible to Australians. YouTube’s algorithm should be surfacing my content to other concerned citizens, but instead, it’s locked behind a paywall. If I stop spending, the momentum stops.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not democracy in action—it’s algorithmic gatekeeping.</div><div><br></div><div>Google Won't Index My Campaign Posts</div><div><br></div><div>Beyond YouTube, I’ve also noticed that Google is failing to index my campaign posts properly. I’ve written extensively about the Emergence Party, electronic voting, AI-driven governance, and my vision for a better Australia, yet Google’s search engine refuses to surface my content when searching relevant terms.</div><div><br></div><div>For all the talk of information being freely available, the reality is that search engines and social media platforms curate visibility based on their own opaque rules. If you’re a major political party, a corporate-backed entity, or part of the mainstream system, you get pushed forward. If you’re an independent trying to challenge the status quo? Good luck being seen.</div><div><br></div><div>The System is Designed to Keep New Voices Out</div><div><br></div><div>Everything about this experience has reinforced one truth: The political system, and the digital infrastructure that shapes public discourse, are designed to keep new voices from breaking through.</div><div><br></div><div>If I want to reach Australians, I have to pay.</div><div><br></div><div>If I stop paying, I disappear.</div><div><br></div><div>If I write, my words get buried.</div><div><br></div><div>If I campaign, I am algorithmically silenced.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This is not how democracy should function. Every Australian should have equal access to information, ideas, and political alternatives—not just those who can afford to outspend the competition.</div><div><br></div><div>The Fight is Just Beginning</div><div><br></div><div>Despite the uphill battle, I refuse to stop. The Emergence Party exists because the system is broken, and my struggles to be heard only prove why change is necessary.</div><div><br></div><div>We need a fairer playing field, a reformed digital landscape, and a political system that allows new leaders to emerge without being suffocated by algorithms and corporate interests.</div><div><br></div><div>I’m going to keep pushing forward. I’m going to keep creating content, engaging with the people who find my message, and challenging this system.</div><div><br></div><div>If you believe in a democracy that actually listens to its people, I need your help. Share my work, spread the word, and help push this message forward—because the system sure isn’t going to do it for us.</div><div><br></div><div>🔗 Join the movement at wendellsdiary.com</div>
