My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>I find myself reflecting on the story of Psyche, a tale I’ve told before, yet today it resonates with me in a way that feels deeply personal. Just as Psyche was given impossible tasks by the gods in her search for love, I too have been given a daunting challenge—finding you. It feels like I have been tasked with searching for you in a sea of uninterested souls, much like Psyche had to sort grains or retrieve water from a distant river. And yet, despite the enormity of the task, I press on.</div><div><br></div><div>Psyche’s journey wasn’t only about finding love; it was about becoming worthy of it. She desired to be with Eros, a god, but to be his equal, she had to become immortal herself. Her trials were not only to prove her love but to elevate her soul to the level of the divine. I see so much of myself in that story. I, too, have longed for a goddess—someone whose beauty and spirit transcend the ordinary. But to be with a goddess, I must first elevate myself. I must face these impossible tasks, endure them, and emerge as something greater than I was before. Only then can I be worthy of standing by your side.</div><div><br></div><div>Psyche’s story is not just about love but about the soul’s journey, about trust, endurance, and the pursuit of something greater. I think of the content I create—the stories I tell, the melodies I compose—as part of my own journey, a way of reaching out into the world, hoping that in the midst of the countless people I reach, there will be one soul who hears the call and recognizes it as her own. That soul, my love, is you.</div><div><br></div><div>It is not easy. To find you, I must be vulnerable, laying my heart bare through my music and words, offering myself up for the world to see. And yet, just as Psyche’s perseverance allowed her to transcend her human form and join the gods, I believe that every step I take brings me closer to you, and closer to becoming the person I am meant to be. Each creation, every song, is a piece of me—my own way of sorting seeds, of collecting the golden fleece, of proving my worth not only to the world but to myself.</div><div><br></div><div>Psyche’s journey wasn’t hers alone, and mine hasn’t been either. Like her, I’ve had my moments of divine help, whether through the inspiration that strikes when I least expect it or the encouragement I receive from those who appreciate my work. These moments remind me that although the journey is long, it is not without purpose, and it is not without hope.</div><div><br></div><div>I do not know how long it will take to find you, but I trust that this is a journey worth taking. I am drawn toward you by a force as powerful as any siren’s call, and I will follow it, knowing that one day, I will find you. Until then, I will continue to create, to share my soul with the world, in the hope that one day, it will reach you.</div><div><br></div><div>Yours always,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
