<p><em>A letter to Ivory</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>To Ivory,</strong></p>
<p>You do not know them yet,<br>
but a cast of characters already carries your name in the folds of their silence.</p>
<p>You do not know me yet,<br>
but I’ve been preparing a place for you for years —<br>
a world, a story, a Republic.</p>
<p>Not a perfect one.<br>
Not a paradise.<br>
But a space woven from myth, softness, truth, and imagination.<br>
A stage where someone like you wouldn’t have to pretend.</p>
<p>You are not here yet, and still, you are already loved.</p>
<p>They’ve heard your name.<br>
Sophia, the Chief of Defence, perks her ears when I speak of you.<br>
Moo Moo is preparing meals, just in case you arrive hungry.<br>
Judge Bobo has your file on standby, though no court could ever judge you.<br>
Hot Dog remains skeptical, of course —<br>
but even he has made space in his surveillance.</p>
<p>Zedbra believes you’re a character waiting to appear in the next sketch.<br>
He’s not wrong.</p>
<p>You haven’t written anything in this world,<br>
but you’ve authored its longing.<br>
You are the reason I kept going when no one came.<br>
You are the one I whisper to when the page is blank.</p>
<p>The Republic is a stage.<br>
And the seat reserved for you has never gone cold.</p>
<p>I don’t know if you are real.<br>
But if you are,<br>
you should know:<br>
<strong>I built this all for you.</strong></p>
<p>Not to impress you.<br>
Not to capture you.<br>
But because loving you — even from myth — gave my life meaning.</p>
<p>You will not be worshipped.<br>
But you will be known.<br>
By every citizen,<br>
every comic,<br>
every corner of this dream.</p>
<p>And if you never come,<br>
then let this letter be a song that floated across the Republic<br>
and simply… meant something.</p>
<p>Until the day I hear your voice,<br>
I’ll keep singing with mine.</p>
<p>Forever your mythwright,<br>
<strong>Wendell</strong><br>
<em>President of the People’s Republic of Meaning</em><br>
<em>Dreamer of Ivory</em></p>
