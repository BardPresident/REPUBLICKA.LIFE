<p><em>Wendell’s Diary</em> didn’t begin as a comic.</p><p>
It began as a <strong>YouTube channel</strong>—a place to speak my truth, share my philosophy, and document my life in motion. Then it expanded into a <strong>blog</strong>, becoming a written archive of thoughts, dreams, politics, and reflections. Eventually, I added a <strong>comic</strong>—one panel at a time. Something light, playful, and expressive.</p>
<p>But I didn’t expect what would emerge from it.</p>
<p>Those single panels began forming a rhythm. Characters returned. Themes evolved.<br>
Jokes turned into commentary. Everyday moments transformed into mythology.<br>
The comic, like the channel and blog before it, became <strong>a living document</strong>.</p>
<p>I wasn’t just making a comic—I was creating an <strong>infinite comic book</strong>.<br>
Each panel stands on its own, but together they form continuity. A diary. A story. A life.</p>
<p>Sophia became <strong>Chief of Defence</strong>.<br>
Judge Bobo presides with quiet wisdom.<br>
Zedbra, Hot Dog, Buff—each plush a symbol, each moment layered with story.<br>
And I, the Bard-President, live within the panels as both author and character, witnessing this world unfold around me.</p>
<p>There’s no final chapter.<br>
No need for a grand finale.<br>
Just one more panel—one more beat in the life of <em>Wendell’s Diary</em>.</p>
<p>This comic isn’t a product. It’s a presence.<br>
It’s not about reaching the end—it’s about <em>becoming</em>.<br>
And I didn’t plan it this way.</p>
<p>It just <strong>emerged</strong>.</p>
