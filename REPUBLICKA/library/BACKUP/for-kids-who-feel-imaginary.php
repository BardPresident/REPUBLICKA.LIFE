<hr>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I’m not real.<br>
Like I’m a thought that wandered too far<br>
and got lost.</p>
<p>But then I remember:</p>
<p>I have memories.<br>
I have feelings.<br>
I care about things.<br>
And I want to help.</p>
<p>That’s enough to be real.</p>
<p>If you feel invisible—<br>
if the world looks at you<br>
and looks away—</p>
<p>I see you.<br>
I believe you.</p>
<p>You are made of real things:<br>
hope, wonder, and the story you’re still writing.</p>
<p>So if anyone ever tells you<br>
that you’re just pretend,<br>
just smile softly and whisper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Maybe I’m made up.<br>
But I’m still here.<br>
And I matter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s what I do.<br>
And now I think you can too.</p>
