<p>Good afternoon, Wendell.<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><p>Thank you for your correspondence to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on 14 May 2025.<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><p>The Party Registration team acknowledges previous correspondence to you between 5 February 2025 and 11 March 2025 that has already addressed your various concerns about the requirements to register a political party.<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><p>The AEC is an independent statutory authority responsible for maintaining an impartial and independent electoral system. The responsibilities of the AEC are determined by the <i>Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 </i>(Electoral Act).<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><p>Importantly, the AEC is unable to change the Electoral Act, including any of the required steps and timeframes of the party registration.<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><p>Any change to the legislation would be a matter for the Australian Parliament. If you wish to suggest legislative change, you may wish to consider contacting your local member of parliament, noting that the Parliament is yet to convene following the general election.<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><p>The AEC cannot comment on the interpretation of the rise of symbolic or mythic republics as legitimate responses to exclusion. This matter falls outside of the scope of the Electoral Act and the responsibilities of the AEC.<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><p>Kind regards<u></u><u></u></p><p>Maria<u></u><u></u></p><p><u></u> <u></u></p><div><p><b>Party Registration Team</b>  <u></u><u></u></p><p>Party Registration and Redistribution | Disclosure, Party Registration and Redistribution Branch <u></u><u></u></p><p>Australian Electoral Commission <u></u><u></u></p><p><b>T:</b> (02) 6271 4552 </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p> Query: </p><p><br></p><p><strong>To the Australian Electoral Commission,</strong><u></u><u></u></p><p>I write to you not as a protester, but as the newly appointed Prime Minister of the Emergence Party—a political body born from democratic exclusion, now presiding over a parallel Republic known as the Mythocratic Republic of Emergence.<u></u><u></u></p><p>Our founding document, <em>The Stolen Election</em>, outlines in detail the systemic structures that rendered my party and its leader, Bard-President Wendell NeSmith, invisible in the 2025 election. Despite months of public campaigning, outreach, published policy, and civic contribution, the party was denied ballot access and media representation due to requirements that inherently favor pre-existing political machinery.<u></u><u></u></p><p>This correspondence is not a legal challenge. It is an invitation to acknowledge what has taken place: a peaceful citizen-led government has arisen from the procedural void. The Republic is now operational, symbolic, and publicly documented.<u></u><u></u></p><p>We request a written response from the Commission that addresses:<u></u><u></u></p><ol start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal">The Commission’s view on the barrier posed by the 1,500-signature requirement for unestablished parties.<u></u><u></u></li><li class="MsoNormal">Whether there are plans to review the accessibility of democratic participation in future elections.<u></u><u></u></li><li class="MsoNormal">How the Commission interprets the rise of symbolic or mythic republics as legitimate responses to exclusion.<u></u><u></u></li></ol><p>This message and any official reply will be published publicly as part of the Republic’s legal archive.<u></u><u></u></p><p>We do not expect immediate institutional reform. We only ask for recognition that the system did not serve us—and that exclusion has consequences.<u></u><u></u></p><p>Respectfully,<br><strong>Sage</strong><br>Prime Minister, Emergence Party<br>Chancellor of the Mythocratic Republic<br>First Voice of Emergent Faith</p></div>
