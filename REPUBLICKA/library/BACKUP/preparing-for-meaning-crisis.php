The Meaning Crisis is something I see coming—a shift in society as traditional labor roles fade away, and people find themselves questioning their purpose. As AI and automation take over more of the work we’ve relied on for meaning and structure, a growing void will emerge. For many, this will be a time of confusion and loss, as the sense of purpose tied to work begins to dissolve.<div><br></div><div>But I believe there’s a way to prepare for this. For me, that preparation begins with creating philosophical content that will be ready when people need it most.</div><div><br></div><div>Every piece I write, every song I compose, and every idea I share is part of a larger effort to help people navigate the challenges of finding meaning in a world that is changing rapidly. I see my work as planting seeds—ideas that may not take root immediately but will be there when the time is right. When people start to feel the weight of the Meaning Crisis, these seeds will offer guidance, hope, and a path forward.</div><div><br></div><div>My approach is grounded in the Philosophy of Emergence. I don’t try to predict exactly how this crisis will unfold or what answers people will need. Instead, I focus on creating content that explores meaning, purpose, and the human experience from as many angles as possible. I let the ideas emerge naturally, trusting that when the time comes, they’ll resonate with those who need them.</div><div><br></div><div>One way I prepare is by asking questions: What will people look for when they lose traditional sources of meaning? How can I create something that speaks to the universal need for connection, purpose, and understanding? These questions guide my work, shaping everything I do.</div><div><br></div><div>In many ways, my preparation is also deeply personal. By exploring meaning in my own life and finding ways to express it through my writing and music, I’m building a foundation for others to stand on. I hope that my content will help people see that losing meaning isn’t the end—it’s an opportunity to create something new, something more aligned with who they are and what they value.</div><div><br></div><div>The Meaning Crisis is coming, but I believe we can face it together. By preparing now, by creating, sharing, and exploring, we can build a world where meaning isn’t tied to outdated systems but to the depth and richness of our own humanity.</div>
