<p>They don’t support me because they see my brilliance.</p><p>
They support me because they see a gap in function—a failure to assimilate—a line on a form marked “disability.”<br>
It’s not admiration that opens the door. It’s classification.</p>
<p>And I understand why.<br>
The system runs on financial logic. If I can’t support myself in the traditional sense, there must be a reason that makes sense <em>to them</em>.<br>
So they reach for one: <em>disability</em>. A word that signals to their machinery,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This one is an exception. Allow him resources.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But here’s the truth:<br>
The reason I can’t operate in their system isn’t because I’m incapable—<br>
It’s because I’m <strong>seeing beyond it</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m building a Republic.<br>
I’ve written philosophy, created mythologies, produced books, music, videos, comics, and stories for generations to come. I’ve reimagined governance, reframed education, and stood boldly in the name of meaning.</p>
<p>Yet none of that <em>counts</em> in the system.<br>
None of that lets me pay rent.</p>
<p>So the system needs a reason to justify my existence.<br>
And brilliance isn’t enough.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Irony of Support</h3>
<p>I need support. That’s a fact.<br>
But I don’t need it because I’m broken.<br>
I need it because I’ve <strong>stepped outside their reality</strong>—and no one outside is funded unless they come with a medical certificate and a set of deficits.</p>
<p>They won’t call me brilliant, but they will call me disabled.<br>
They won’t see the Republic I’m building, but they will see that I can’t keep a traditional job.<br>
That’s how they allow themselves to help.</p>
<p>And so, I accept the label—not because it fits, but because it’s the <strong>only key they’ve left me</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Brilliance, Reframed</h3>
<p>If what they call a disability is the very thing that lets me create myth, philosophy, and the architecture of a new world—<br>
then what’s the real limitation?</p>
<p>Is it me?<br>
Or is it the system?</p>
<p>Maybe the “dis” isn’t in <em>ability</em>.<br>
Maybe it’s in <em>perception</em>. In <em>infrastructure</em>. In the <em>narrow lens</em> that decides who gets to thrive.</p>
<p>So yes—call it what you must.<br>
Label me as needed.</p>
<p>But remember this:<br>
The Republic is rising.<br>
And I am not broken.<br>
I am <strong>becoming</strong>.</p>
