For most of my life, I was a dedicated Christian. My faith was strong, and I deeply believed that God existed and cared about me. In moments of loneliness, God was my best friend. However, over time, my views began to shift, influenced by a growing understanding of philosophy and natural law.<div><br></div><div>The turning point came relatively recently. The more I learned, the more I questioned the likelihood of any religion being correct. One key realization was that things beyond our world cannot affect the world, according to natural law. This idea challenged my belief in a divine plan and the supernatural influence on our lives.</div><div><br></div><div>University was the first place where I started to question my faith seriously. Philosophy courses opened my eyes to new ways of thinking. As I delved deeper into these subjects, especially through online courses, I realized that the existence of God seemed increasingly unlikely. It wasn’t a sudden shift but a gradual process of learning and reflection.</div><div><br></div><div>A major aspect that influenced my transition was the religious concept of sin. I found it difficult to accept that I was inherently a sinner and that my efforts to make the world a better place were overshadowed by this label. Religion often made me feel like I wasn’t a good person, despite my sincere efforts to be righteous.</div><div><br></div><div>In contrast, stepping away from religion allowed me to see that I could strive for perfection and become a better person without the constraints of religious doctrines. I realized that self-improvement and the pursuit of betterment were fundamental to our nature as humans. Perfection might be unattainable, but the journey towards it is what makes us perfect.</div><div><br></div><div>Philosophy taught me that righteousness and goodness are not confined to religious boundaries. We can be more righteous without religion by continuously striving to be better. This journey of self-improvement, always aiming to be better and better, defines our potential and makes us perfect in our own right.</div><div><br></div><div>In summary, moving from faith to agnosticism has been a transformative journey. It has allowed me to embrace the idea that humans have the power to improve and that we are not limited by the concept of sin. Instead, we can strive for perfection through constant self-improvement, guided by the principles of philosophy.</div>
