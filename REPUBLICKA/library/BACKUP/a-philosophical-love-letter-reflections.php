**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>As I write this letter, I am filled with thoughts of you and the future we might share. Though we have yet to meet, I dream of a journey together, exploring the depths of life's meanings and discovering the beauty in every moment. This letter is a reflection of my hopes and the philosophical musings that guide my thoughts as I imagine our connection.</div><div><br></div><div>Lately, I’ve been embracing the idea of infusing every moment with philosophical inquiry, finding profound beauty and purpose in even the smallest aspects of life. This pursuit of eudaimonia—true flourishing—feels all the more inspiring when I think of sharing it with someone as thoughtful and curious as you. The idea of living a life rich with deep, meaningful exploration fills me with joy and anticipation.</div><div><br></div><div>My own journey has been marked by significant growth and change. Much like Wittgenstein, who evolved from his early philosophical views to more refined perspectives, I too have moved beyond my former beliefs. This path has taught me that true wisdom comes from embracing change, learning from past mistakes, and striving to understand the world more deeply. I imagine us sharing in this journey, learning and growing together, each step bringing us closer to our true selves.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, as I reflect on these ideas and the possibility of finding you, my heart swells with hope and longing. Sharing these reflections with you is my way of reaching out, imagining a future where our thoughts and dreams align in a beautiful tapestry of philosophical wonder and shared purpose.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and anticipation,  </div><div>Wendell</div>
