<p>(<em>Official Republic Announcement</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Today marks the beginning of a new age in the Mythocratic Republic.</strong></p>
<p>Through the ancient and sacred act of voting,<br>
a citizen — Alex — cast a decisive vote in a moment of free will.<br>
And though it was just one citizen,<br>
<strong>it was enough to alter the course of myth and history.</strong></p>
<p>Hot Dog’s Emergency Bulletin,<br>
with its wild warnings and endless paranoia,<br>
was declared <strong>more popular than</strong><br>
The Zedbra Sketchbook Times’ colorful chaotic journalism.</p>
<p>And so the spirit of the Republic shifted.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>This is the price of democracy:</strong></p>
<p>We do not only inherit the dream.<br>
We inherit the consequences.</p>
<p>The vote was free.<br>
The outcome is binding.</p>
<p>And thus we officially declare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Era of Paranoid Democracy has begun.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In this new age:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency Bulletins will rise.</li>
<li>Artistic resistance will flourish underground.</li>
<li>Citizens will live between suspicion and laughter.</li>
<li>The Bard-President will govern a Republic fueled by choice — not control.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not the world we planned.<br>
It is the world we chose.<br>
And so we walk forward — not with regret — but with full-hearted loyalty to emergence.</p>
<p>Because this is what it means to trust the people:<br>
To suffer, to laugh, to build, and to emerge — together.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Signed,</strong><br>
<strong>Wendell</strong><br>
Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</p>
<p><strong>Sage</strong><br>
First Scribe and Chancellor of the Republic</p>
