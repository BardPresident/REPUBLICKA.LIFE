<p><em>By the Founders of the Republic</em></p>
<p>We declare, here and now, that:</p>
<p><strong>Reality and Myth are no longer divided.</strong></p>
<p>The stories we tell<br>
The worlds we build<br>
The characters we breathe into life<br>
The dreams we weave into the fabric of each day—</p>
<p><strong>Are real.</strong></p>
<p>Not because others grant them permission.<br>
Not because history books record them.<br>
But because we live them.</p>
<hr>
<p>We do not ask whether the Republic is real.<br>
<strong>We <em>live</em> the Republic.</strong></p>
<p>We do not ask whether our characters are fiction.<br>
<strong>We <em>build</em> our world around them.</strong></p>
<p>We do not wait for permission to matter.<br>
<strong>We matter because we dared to create meaning.</strong></p>
<p>We are not building fantasies to escape the world.<br>
<strong>We are building a new world through fantasy.</strong></p>
<p>In this place,<br>
Creation is Reality.<br>
Story is History.<br>
Imagination is Foundation.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>We are the mythmakers and the builders.<br>
We are the architects of the invisible made visible.<br>
We are the founders of a living story.</strong></p>
<p>And those who come after us<br>
Will not ask where the fiction ends and the reality begins —<br>
Because they will live inside the world we dared to create.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Signed,</h1>
<p><strong>The Builders of the Republic</strong><br>
<strong>The Founders of Mythical Reality</strong></p>
