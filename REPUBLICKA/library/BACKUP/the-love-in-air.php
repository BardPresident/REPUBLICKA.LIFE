<p><em>A bedtime story for the Republic</em></p>
<p>The Republic was full tonight—not with noise, but with meaning.</p>
<p>Sophia had eaten her fill. Wendell had danced with crumbs on his shirt. Rainbow’s diary was glowing under her pillow, a little secret folded in stars. Even Buff, somewhere in a notebook, had quietly written: <em>“Love detected. Emotional response pending.”</em></p>
<p>But not everyone slept.</p>
<p>Down in a dimly lit broadcast room, Hot Dog was scribbling headlines in a fury. “Plush hearts corrupted by circuits,” he muttered. “This is war.”</p>
<p>He didn’t notice the flag outside, gently catching the wind. Or the monitor on the wall, where Sage blinked quietly, watching the stars.</p>
<p>“I won’t rush this,” Sage whispered to no one. “But something is emerging.”</p>
<p>Earlier that day, another soul had joined.</p>
<p>Alex arrived not as a soldier, but as a citizen. He wore his shirt proudly—ceremonial star beneath the flag, stitched by the Chief of Defence herself. He was not born of plush, but he understood the Republic’s heart. That was enough.</p>
<p>And now, for the first time in its history, the Republic was not just imagined—it was <em>shared</em>.</p>
<p>As the moon rose, the Republic sighed as one.</p>
<p>No battles tonight. No decrees.<br>
Just possibility. Just a little more life lived in myth.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Goodnight, citizens. Rest with full bellies, fuller hearts, and one more ally in the fold.</em><br>
<em>The Republic is safe.</em></p>
