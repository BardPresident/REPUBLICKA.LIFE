As someone who loves to share thoughts and insights with the world, finding the right platform to publish my content was crucial. Initially, I used to write books, but I wanted my content to become public and accessible even after my death. That's when I discovered Blogger by Google, a platform that met my needs perfectly.<div><br></div><div>**The Simplicity and Efficiency of Blogger**</div><div><br></div><div>Blogger has proven to be incredibly user-friendly. The app is straightforward, allowing me to post my blogs in about 20 seconds. All I need to do is copy and paste the content, add a few labels, and it's ready to go. Unlike YouTube, where creating a video involves thumbnails, descriptions, and more, Blogger requires minimal effort, which I greatly appreciate.</div><div><br></div><div>**The Frustration of Being Blocked**</div><div><br></div><div>However, my experience hasn't been entirely smooth. When I tried to share my blog on Facebook and Reddit, both platforms flagged it as spam. Facebook immediately prevented me from posting my blog links and even blocked my YouTube videos that contained those links. Reddit went a step further and blocked entire groups where I shared my blog. Despite reaching out to support multiple times, I couldn't get in contact with a real person to resolve the issue.</div><div><br></div><div>**Why I Stick with Blogger**</div><div><br></div><div>Despite these challenges, I continue to use Blogger because it is free, simple, and fast. Its simplicity is its greatest strength; it allows me to focus on my content without getting bogged down by unnecessary features. While it meets most of my needs, I do hope that Blogger integrates text-to-speech functionality in the future, which would be a great addition.</div><div><br></div><div>**Overcoming Sharing Limitations**</div><div><br></div><div>To circumvent the issue of my blog being flagged as spam, I linked my blog to my website. Now, instead of sharing my blog's URL directly, I share my website's URL, which in turn links to my blog. This workaround helps me avoid spam detection and still reach my audience. I also promote my blog through my YouTube channel, ensuring my content gets the visibility it deserves.</div><div><br></div><div>**Conclusion**</div><div><br></div><div>My journey with Blogger has been a mix of ease and frustration. The platform's simplicity and efficiency make it an excellent choice for quick and straightforward blogging. However, the hurdles of being flagged as spam on social media are a significant drawback. Despite these issues, the benefits of using Blogger outweigh the downsides, making it my platform of choice for sharing my thoughts with the world.</div>
