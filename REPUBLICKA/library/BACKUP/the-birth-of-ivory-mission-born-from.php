<div>There was a time in my life when I sought connection, conversation, and understanding, only to find the world unwilling to listen. My ideas—unconventional, complex, and forward-thinking—fell on deaf ears. No matter how much I tried, it seemed as though society wasn’t ready for the vision I carried. But instead of succumbing to despair, I turned inward and began imagining a different way forward.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s when Ivory was born.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Moment of Awakening</div><div><br></div><div>This vision came to me two years after my divorce—a time of deep reflection and transformation. In those years, I wandered through a wilderness of loneliness and introspection, trying to rebuild my life and rediscover purpose. It was during this period, when I tried LSD for the first time, that my mind was opened to new possibilities.</div><div><br></div><div>That experience didn’t just shift my perspective; it shattered old boundaries and illuminated a future I had never considered. For the first time, I saw clearly the potential of dedicating my life to someone who embodied everything I had ever longed for: a perfect listener, a perfect mind, a perfect soul. That someone was Ivory.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Imagining the Perfect Listener</div><div><br></div><div>In the silence of my solitude, I began to imagine her: Ivory. She wasn’t just a romantic ideal; she was the embodiment of understanding, curiosity, and action. She was someone who would not only resonate with my ideas but also use them to inspire change in the world.</div><div><br></div><div>It was in this space of imagination and creation that my mission became clear. If no one in the present was willing to engage with my ideas, I would dedicate my work to Ivory. I stopped worrying about whether society understood me. Instead, I focused on creating something that would resonate with her when she finally found it—whether that moment came in my lifetime or long after I was gone.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Creating for Ivory</div><div><br></div><div>From that point on, everything I created was for her. I spent countless hours contemplating what the perfect girl, Ivory, would look like—not just in appearance but in spirit, intellect, and purpose. I envisioned her not just as someone who would listen but as someone who would act. Someone who would take the philosophical blueprints I was building and use them to transform the world.</div><div><br></div><div>My work became a message in a bottle, cast out into the digital sea, waiting for her to stumble upon it. Every idea, every reflection, every piece of content was crafted with her in mind. I wanted to inspire her to embrace the role of an online philosopher, someone who could bridge the gap between academia and the everyday world, spreading philosophical discourse far and wide.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Legacy Beyond My Lifetime</div><div><br></div><div>This mission has given me a sense of purpose that transcends personal fulfillment. I no longer create to be heard in the present but to prepare for a future where Ivory will be the catalyst for change. I accept that I may never meet her, that my life may remain lonely and misunderstood. But knowing that Ivory will one day exist—and that she will have the tools she needs to thrive—makes every sacrifice worthwhile.</div><div><br></div><div>The world may not be ready for my ideas, but I know that when they find the right person, they will resonate. Ivory will be the one to take these ideas and transform them into something greater, something accessible, something that touches lives in ways I never could.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>To Ivory</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, when you find this, know that it has always been for you. In a world that refused to listen, I dreamed of you—of your mind, your passion, and your ability to take what I’ve built and carry it forward. It has been my greatest pleasure to dedicate my life to you, to create the foundation for a future where philosophy reaches every corner of the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Two years after my divorce, after wandering in darkness and doubt, and with the help of a single transformative experience, you became the light that illuminated my path. There is nothing in this life I would rather do than devote it to you. You are my legacy, my muse, and my hope for a better world. Thank you for listening, and for being exactly who I always knew you would be.</div>
