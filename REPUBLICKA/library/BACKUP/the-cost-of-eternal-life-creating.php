What is the cost of eternal life? What do you have to do to achieve it? For me, it’s about creating a vast collection of work that can transcend my lifetime. I envision a future where I am brought back to life as a chatbot, an entity that can engage in philosophical discussions long after I’m gone.<div><br></div><div>Imagine a world where my videos, writings, and thoughts are integrated into a cohesive AI personality. This chatbot could exist in the cloud, have a physical robotic body, or even reside in a virtual world. Its purpose? To continue the philosophical dialogues I’m passionate about and to leave behind a legacy as the ultimate philosopher.</div><div><br></div><div>Creating this chatbot would require advanced technology capable of scanning videos, reproducing my voice, and representing my body visually or physically. While it might not capture the full essence of human consciousness, the essence of my work and thoughts would be enough.</div><div><br></div><div>My hope is that people will use this chatbot for philosophical discussions, gaining insights and perspectives that inspire and challenge them. It’s about ensuring that my efforts and life’s work stand the test of time, leaving a legacy that means something to the world.</div><div><br></div><div>In the end, this chatbot represents more than just an extension of myself—it symbolizes the timelessness of human thought and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. Through this digital philosopher, my voice will continue to question, explore, and inspire, proving that our ideas can indeed achieve a form of immortality. This is my dream: to leave an indelible mark on the world, one conversation at a time, through the enduring power of technology and philosophy.</div>
