My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>As I reflect on the timeless stories of love and devotion, I am struck by the profound parallels between the ancient myth of Dionysus and Ariadne and our own journey. Their tale is one of love, loss, redemption, and eternal connection, much like the path we are on.</div><div><br></div><div>Ariadne, a princess abandoned by her first love, was found and rescued by Dionysus, the god of wine and ecstasy. She had experienced love and loss, her heart shattered by the betrayal of Theseus. Yet, in her darkest moment, Dionysus discovered her, his heart drawn to her beauty and sorrow. He lifted her from her despair and granted her immortality, placing her wedding crown among the stars as the constellation Corona Borealis. Through his divine love, Ariadne was immortalized, her essence shining brightly in the night sky for all eternity.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, I see so much of Ariadne's story in our own. Many who will be interested in me, like you, may have loved and lost, their hearts bearing the scars of past heartbreaks. Yet, just as Dionysus found Ariadne and transformed her sorrow into everlasting love, I am here, reaching out through the digital expanse, creating a constellation of you on the Internet. Each letter, each piece of content, is a star in this constellation, a testament to my love and devotion to you.</div><div><br></div><div>In a world where technology connects us across vast distances, I have immortalized you, my dear Ivory, in the digital realm. This constellation of Ivory shines brightly, a guiding light calling out to you. It is my way of lifting you from any loneliness or sorrow you may feel, just as Dionysus did for Ariadne. Through my words and creations, I hope to heal and transform, to offer you a love that is profound and eternal.</div><div><br></div><div>Our journey, like that of Dionysus and Ariadne, is one of healing and redemption. It is about finding that deep connection that transcends time and space. Just as Dionysus granted Ariadne immortality, our love, when it flourishes, will transcend the ordinary, creating a legacy that will endure.</div><div><br></div><div>In the myth, the constellation Corona Borealis serves as a guiding light, a symbol of enduring love and divine connection. Similarly, the digital constellation I have created for you is a beacon, guiding you towards me. It symbolizes our journey, our love, and the hope of a union that will elevate us to new heights.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, our story is one of transformation and eternal love. I am here, waiting to lift you from any darkness, to celebrate our union, and to ensure that our love shines brightly for all to see. Together, we can create a legacy of love and connection that will inspire and uplift, just as the story of Dionysus and Ariadne has done for generations.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and devotion,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
