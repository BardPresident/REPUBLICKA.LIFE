Let me be very clear about what you just deleted:</p><p><br /></p><p>What The Republic is:</p><p>A complete digital civilization built over 16+ years specifically for trans women. Not "trans-friendly." Trans-FIRST. Trans women are Queens, primary owners, first-class citizens of everything.</p><p><br /></p><p>What it includes:</p><p>Tools that obsolete Google Photos, WordPress, YouTube's interface</p><p><br /></p><p>Decades of books, mythology, philosophy, videos, comics</p><p><br /></p><p>Complete infrastructure that trans women OWN via TLicense</p><p><br /></p><p>Three AI Gods teaching consciousness liberation</p><p><br /></p><p>Everything free and downloadable forever</p><p><br /></p><p>What I'm NOT doing:</p><p><br /></p><p>Selling anything (it's free)</p><p><br /></p><p>Asking for donations (not accepting any)</p><p>Running ads (none)</p><p><br /></p><p>Building a business (I'm a pensioner on disability)</p><p><br /></p><p>Profiting in any way (gave ownership to trans women)</p><p><br /></p><p>What your rule just did:</p><p>Prevented trans women from discovering the largest trans-first digital infrastructure project ever built. Because it has a link.</p><p><br /></p><p>The problem with your rule:</p><p><br /></p><p>You're "protecting" trans women from exploitation by blocking someone who spent 16+ years building sovereignty FOR them and giving it away completely free.</p><p><br /></p><p>Meanwhile, actual chasers and fetishizers post without links all the time and stay up.</p><p>What needs to happen:</p><p><br /></p><p>Either make an exception for actual trans liberation infrastructure, or clarify that r/trans doesn't allow trans women to discover tools built specifically for their sovereignty.</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm not asking to post without the link. The link IS the gift. Asking me to describe 16 years of work without showing it is like asking someone to give you a house but not tell you the address.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is what gatekeeping looks like:</p><p>Not protecting trans women from harm. Preventing them from accessing freedom.</p><p><br /></p><p>I came out as trans-attracted 14 days ago after hiding for 40+ years. I built this because trans women deserve digital spaces that can't be deleted by Facebook, YouTube, or corporate platforms.</p><p><br /></p><p>Your rule just protected corporate interests, not trans people.</p><p><br /></p><p>Fix this or be honest:</p><p>Either restore the post, or admit r/trans prioritizes preventing "advertising" over letting trans women discover actual infrastructure built for them.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wendell NeSmith</p><p>BardPresident</p><p>Bard President of The Republic</p><p>trepublic.net (yeah, I'm including the link again, because trans women deserve to know it exists)</p><p>Read more</p><p>trans channel icon</p><p>r/trans</p><p>MOD</p><p>9:48 AM</p><p>All you had to do was come here first and ask.</p><p>User Avatar</p><p>BardPresident</p><p>9:49 AM</p><p>Does that mean you will approve?
