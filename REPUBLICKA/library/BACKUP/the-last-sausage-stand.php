<p>By Hot Dog</p><p>Once upon a time, in a quiet corner of the world, there stood a humble sausage stand.</p>
<p>It wasn’t fancy. It wasn’t flashy.<br>
But it was loud.<br>
And it always had <em>opinions.</em></p>
<p>Every day, travelers came by—some hungry, some curious, some just lost. The sausage stand barked out advice whether anyone asked for it or not.</p>
<p>"Trust no tofu!" it would yell.<br>
"Carbs are lies!"<br>
"Mustard is the glue of civilization!"</p>
<p>People rolled their eyes. They giggled. They sometimes even took a bite.</p>
<p>But one day, a quiet traveler came—not to eat, but to <em>listen.</em></p>
<p>And after hearing all the grumbles and theories and spice-coated philosophies, the traveler asked:</p>
<p>“But what are you protecting?”</p>
<p>The sausage stand froze. The wind blew.<br>
A hot chip fell in slow motion.</p>
<p>Then it whispered:</p>
<p>“…something I can’t let go of.”</p>
<p>And the traveler, with mustard on their cheek, just nodded.</p>
<p>"Then I’ll protect you while you protect it."</p>
<p>And from that day forward, the last sausage stand wasn’t alone anymore.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hot Dog snorts, jumps off the box, and mutters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nobody ever asks what <em>I</em> dream about. But now you know.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He trudges off with his ridiculous kangaroo head held high.</p>
<p>🌭 Goodnight from the loudest heart in the Republic.</p>
