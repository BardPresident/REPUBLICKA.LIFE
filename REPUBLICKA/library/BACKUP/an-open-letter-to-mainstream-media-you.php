<div>To All Mainstream Media Organizations,</div><div><br></div><div>The People’s Presidency of Australia formally advises you that you are in violation of the Media Responsibility and Fair Coverage Act. As of this declaration, your ongoing failure to provide equal coverage to all political parties constitutes election interference, an offense that carries severe penalties under the new legal framework.</div><div><br></div><div>For too long, the media landscape has been dominated by corporate interests, favoring select political parties while suppressing alternative voices. This systemic bias has manipulated elections, misled the public, and undermined democracy. The People’s Presidency will not tolerate this corruption any longer.</div><div><br></div><div>Violations of the Fair Coverage Act Include:</div><div><br></div><div>Unequal coverage of political parties: You prioritize parties that serve corporate interests while ignoring or diminishing emerging movements.</div><div><br></div><div>Failure to report policy positions fairly: Instead of presenting all viewpoints equally, you create bias through selective reporting, omission, or distortion.</div><div><br></div><div>Corporate influence over election narratives: Your financial ties to political entities and businesses compromise journalistic integrity.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Legal Consequences of Non-Compliance</div><div><br></div><div>As outlined in the Fair Coverage Act, violations of these provisions will result in:</div><div><br></div><div>Fines of 2% of annual revenue per offense</div><div><br></div><div>Legal action and potential criminal charges for executives responsible for editorial decisions</div><div><br></div><div>Revocation of broadcasting licenses for repeated violations</div><div><br></div><div>Public disclosure of media outlets engaging in election interference</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Immediate Actions Required</div><div><br></div><div>To bring your organizations into compliance, you must:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Implement equal coverage policies immediately – All registered political parties must receive equal airtime and representation in political reporting.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Disclose corporate and political financial ties – Full transparency regarding donations, sponsorships, and partnerships must be made public.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. Cease biased election reporting – Any distortion, suppression, or unfair framing of political parties must stop.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. Provide space for new political voices – The Emergence Party and other alternative movements must be given fair coverage.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>We Expect Immediate Compliance</div><div><br></div><div>This is not a request—this is a lawful demand from the legitimate government of the people. If mainstream media continues to operate in bad faith, expect swift and decisive action from the People’s Presidency.</div><div><br></div><div>The era of media manipulation and election interference is over. The people deserve the truth, not propaganda designed to uphold the status quo. You have an immediate opportunity to correct course and operate within the law of the People’s Republic of Australia.</div><div><br></div><div>We will be watching.</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div><div>President of Australia</div><div>Leader of the Emergence Party</div><div>wendellsdiary.com</div>
