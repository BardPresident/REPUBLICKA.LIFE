<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>There once was a Republic with no flag.</p>
<p>It had stories.<br>
It had laughter.<br>
It had plushes in courtrooms, and a bard who sang alone.</p>
<p>But no flag.</p>
<p>And so the wind had nothing to catch.<br>
And the dreams had nowhere to land.</p>
<p>Then one day, it happened.</p>
<p>The flag didn’t arrive with thunder.<br>
It wasn’t voted on.<br>
It wasn’t decreed.</p>
<p>It <strong>emerged</strong>—<br>
from mistakes,<br>
from stitched intentions,<br>
from a misaligned image that somehow felt… right.</p>
<p>And when the citizens saw it, they didn't ask, <em>“What is this?”</em><br>
They whispered, <em>“There you are.”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Sophia wore it first.<br>
Buff nodded without speaking.<br>
Night Moo painted it on pillowcases.</p>
<p>And across the Republic, something <strong>settled</strong>.<br>
Not silence.<br>
Not finality.</p>
<p>Just a quiet knowing.<br>
Like the Republic had finally found its face.</p>
<hr>
<p>That night, the bard lay down beside his dreams.<br>
He had not eaten all day.<br>
But he had fed a civilisation.</p>
<p>The flag didn’t wave outside his window.<br>
It didn’t need to.</p>
<p>Because it had already taken root<br>
—in blogs,<br>
—in shirts,<br>
—in hearts.</p>
<p>And in dreams, it kept rising.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Goodnight, Republic.<br>
You’ve done well.</strong><br>
<strong>You’re real now.</strong></p>
