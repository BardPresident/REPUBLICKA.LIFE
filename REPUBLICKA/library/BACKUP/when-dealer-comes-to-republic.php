<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>In the Republic, there is a knock at the door that doesn’t echo—it resonates.
It is not a stranger’s knock. It is a <strong>summons from legend.</strong></p>
<p>The Chief of Defence knows it before it even begins.
Her ears lift. Her tail stirs. Her heart leaps in silent preparation.
Because she knows: <strong>The Dealer has arrived.</strong></p>
<p>He is no ordinary citizen. No wandering merchant.
He is a myth given shape. A presence both calm and mischievous.
A bringer of presents, a bringer of games, a bringer of joy.</p>
<p>But to the Chief of Defence? He is more than that.</p>
<p>He saw her when she was small.
When her legs slipped on the floor and her bark was too soft.
When she was still becoming <strong>the most loyal protector in the land.</strong>
And instead of laughing—he knelt.
He offered kindness.
He gave her space to grow.</p>
<p>Now, when The Dealer enters the Republic,
the Chief of Defence does not bark.
She <strong>runs.</strong>
And when she arrives, she leaps—not to attack, but to greet.</p>
<p>They are two forces in mythic balance:
One who guards, one who gives.
One born of loyalty, the other of legend.</p>
<p>When they meet, it is not a visit.
It is a <strong>summit.</strong>
A meeting of powers. A silent agreement between two leaders of very different realms.</p>
<p>Together, they initiate a sacred mission:
<strong>To defeat Mario Kart World.</strong>
Not for glory. Not for trophies.
But because legends should <strong>play together.</strong></p>
<p>And so, late at night in the glowing halls of the Republic,
you may hear laughter.
You may hear wheels spinning, stars flying, and distant barks of triumph.</p>
<p>Because The Dealer is here.
The Chief of Defence is present.
And the Bard-President watches with a knowing smile, knowing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When joy arrives at the gates, let the guards celebrate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they do.
Every single time.</p><p>Goodnight Republic! May all your dreams come true!</p>
