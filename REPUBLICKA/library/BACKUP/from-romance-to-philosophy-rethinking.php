<div>As we continue exploring how schools can better prepare students for life, we’ve found ourselves on a fascinating journey. What began as a discussion about teaching romantic relationships in high school has evolved into a broader exploration of philosophy and its place in education. Here’s how this train of thought unfolded.</div><div><br></div><div>Romance and Relationships in School</div><div><br></div><div>We started by recognizing that many students begin dating while still in school, yet schools rarely teach the skills needed for healthy romantic relationships. We explored the importance of:</div><div><br></div><div>Loyalty and commitment: Key traits for building meaningful relationships, whether romantic or platonic.</div><div><br></div><div>Conflict resolution: The ability to navigate disagreements in a way that fosters mutual understanding and leads to win-win outcomes.</div><div><br></div><div>Emotional intelligence: Understanding one’s own emotions and those of others to create balanced, respectful relationships.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>These are universal skills that benefit students in all areas of life, not just in romance.</div><div><br></div><div>The Role of Philosophy in Relationships</div><div><br></div><div>As we delved deeper, we realized that teaching these skills effectively requires a philosophical foundation. Philosophy provides the tools to reflect on loyalty, commitment, and how to be a good friend or partner. Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, for example, explores the nature of friendships and virtues, offering timeless insights into relationships.</div><div><br></div><div>We noted the absence of philosophy in K-12 education and how incorporating it could transform the way students approach not only relationships but life as a whole.</div><div><br></div><div>Philosophy as a Core Subject</div><div><br></div><div>This led us to a larger question: Should philosophy be a core subject in schools? In a world where AI and technology are phasing out many labor-based roles, there’s an opportunity to return to the roots of education, as seen in Plato’s Academy, where philosophy was central.</div><div><br></div><div>Teaching philosophy could help students:</div><div><br></div><div>Think critically: Analyze problems and navigate life’s complexities.</div><div><br></div><div>Cultivate virtues: Develop traits like empathy, patience, and loyalty that naturally lead to healthier relationships.</div><div><br></div><div>Find meaning: Explore questions about purpose, identity, and how to live a good life.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The Bigger Picture</div><div><br></div><div>While the idea of philosophy as a core subject might not align with current educational trends, it’s a vision worth pursuing. By teaching students to think deeply and ethically, schools could equip them to handle relationships, career challenges, and societal changes with wisdom and resilience.</div><div><br></div><div>A Personal Mission</div><div><br></div><div>For those passionate about philosophy, the next step is clear: to share these ideas with the world. Whether through blogs, videos, or conversations, diving into philosophical topics and making them accessible can help spread this vision and inspire others to think more deeply about their lives and relationships.</div>
