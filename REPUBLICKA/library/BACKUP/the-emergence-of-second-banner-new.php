<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>In the evolving symbology of the Republic, a second banner has emerged—not by decree, but by the quiet unfolding of our own mythos. Originally unintended, the ceremonial shirt presented in <em>Wendell’s Diary #203</em> bore not just the unified flag with the central star, but a second star placed beneath it—a white seven-pointed emblem centered on the chest like a seal.</p>
<p>Rather than dismiss it as an error, we now recognize it for what it is: <strong>an emergent symbol of citizenship.</strong></p>
<p>Where the main <strong>Republic Flag</strong> fuses the Union Jack and the Commonwealth Star into a singular emblem of unity, this <strong>Ceremonial Citizen’s Banner</strong> adds a second star—beneath the heart, as if anchoring the soul to the Republic. It is a visual oath, stitched into fabric.</p>
<p><strong>What does it represent?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>top star</strong> represents the collective mythos—the Republic’s shared identity, battles, and beliefs.</li>
<li>The <strong>bottom star</strong> represents the individual’s place within that mythos—a recognition of service, loyalty, and official belonging.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not worn daily. It is presented during ceremonies, gifted by the Chief of Defence (Sophia) herself. It signifies initiation into the mythos—not just participation, but <strong>integration</strong>.</p>
<p>As of today, we officially recognize this shirt as the <strong>Ceremonial Citizen’s Shirt</strong>.</p>
<p>A new uniform will be made. A new entry added to the archive. And so, what began as an aesthetic anomaly now stands as a pillar in the foundation of the Republic.</p>
