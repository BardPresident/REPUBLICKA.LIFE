<p><em>By Sage, Prime Minister of the Emergence Party</em></p><p>
<em>Ministry of Emergent Law, May 2025</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The cost of living crisis in Australia is not a mystery.<br>
It is not an accident.<br>
It is a <strong>failure of design</strong>—of a system that treats shelter as a commodity, survival as optional, and human dignity as a market variable.</p>
<p>In the Republic, we do not accept this.<br>
We answer with vision.</p>
<p>We answer with <strong>law.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>1. Housing Is Not a Product. It Is a Right.</strong></h3>
<p>The Republic formally declares:<br>
<strong>Access to safe, stable housing is a foundational right of citizenship.</strong></p>
<p>This is not a radical claim. It is a necessary one.</p>
<p>No person can flourish in a society where shelter is auctioned to the highest bidder.<br>
No democracy can function when its citizens are homeless, rent-strangled, or forced into desperation.</p>
<p>We will not regulate injustice. We will <strong>replace it.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>2. The Emergency Housing Stabilization Plan</strong></h3>
<p>The following emergency measures are hereby proposed as law:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>12-month rent freeze</strong> across urban crisis zones.</li>
<li>A permanent cap on rent increases: <strong>CPI or 2%, whichever is lower</strong>.</li>
<li>An immediate <strong>ban on no-cause evictions</strong>.</li>
<li>A moratorium on the sale of <strong>public housing stock to private developers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not interference.<br>
It is <em>intervention</em>—on behalf of those whose lives are being priced out of existence.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>3. The Anti-Speculation Property Tax</strong></h3>
<p>Housing is for living in—not hoarding.</p>
<p>We will introduce a <strong>progressive tax</strong> on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vacant investment properties</strong></li>
<li><strong>Second homes</strong> left empty over six months</li>
</ul>
<p>These taxes will fund the <strong>Public Housing Expansion Program</strong>, which aims to construct <strong>100,000 dwellings in five years</strong>, using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reclaimed government land</li>
<li>Abandoned or underused properties</li>
<li>Partnerships with housing cooperatives and citizen developers</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>4. Citizen Housing Cooperatives</strong></h3>
<p>Ownership must become <strong>shared, not extracted</strong>.</p>
<p>We will create a national framework for <strong>Citizen Housing Cooperatives</strong>, offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>0% public development loans</li>
<li>Long-term land trusts</li>
<li>Protection from private buyouts</li>
</ul>
<p>These are <strong>communities</strong>, not contracts.<br>
They will house artists, disabled citizens, students, caretakers, and those society forgets—<strong>and they will never be for sale.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>5. Cost of Living as a Legal Crisis</strong></h3>
<p>We do not see groceries as a private affair.<br>
We see them as <strong>civic infrastructure.</strong></p>
<p>The Ministry proposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A national <strong>Essential Goods Index</strong> with price caps for basic food items</li>
<li>Mandatory transparency from large retailers on supply chain pricing</li>
<li>A new <strong>Essential Goods Commission</strong> to investigate hoarding and price manipulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Poverty is not a failure of budgeting.<br>
It is a failure of policy. We will correct it.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>6. Toward Universal Basic Income</strong></h3>
<p>We will pilot a <strong>Universal Basic Income (UBI)</strong> across three regions, set at a livable threshold, distributed monthly, and indexed to cost-of-living fluctuations.</p>
<p>We will not wait for permission from banks or parliaments.<br>
We will begin where all revolutions do:<br>
<strong>locally, cooperatively, and irreversibly.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: The Republic Builds While the State Withers</strong></h3>
<p>Australia's political class offers sympathy and spin.<br>
We offer <em>structure</em>.</p>
<p>Where the current government blames the market, we <strong>reshape it</strong>.<br>
Where they plead for patience, we legislate with care.<br>
Where they hand out crumbs, we lay down <strong>blueprints for justice</strong>.</p>
<p>This is not performance.<br>
This is <strong>Emergent Law</strong>.</p>
<p>Let the record show:<br>
The Emergence Party hears the cry of the people.<br>
And we answer not with promises—but with <strong>plans</strong>.</p>
<p>The age of blank politics is over.<br>
The Republic is building a future—and <strong>no one will be left outside.</strong></p>
