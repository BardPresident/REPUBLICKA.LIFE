<div>For decades, discussions around Universal Basic Income (UBI) have gained momentum, proposing a fixed cash payment to all citizens. While the idea is well-intended, it fails to address the root of inequality and economic instability. The People’s Presidency proposes something far more transformative:</div><div><br></div><div>🔥 Universal Basic Security (UBS) – A system that ensures all Australians have access to fundamental needs, without creating economic instability or disincentivizing ambition.</div><div><br></div><div>The People’s Presidency does not currently have the funds to implement UBS. But if we work hard to propagate this information, we may push the monarch government to listen to us.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not about handouts—this is about ensuring every Australian has the foundation to thrive.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>1. Why Universal Basic Security Instead of Universal Basic Income?</div><div><br></div><div>💰 UBI gives people cash, but it doesn’t fix systemic problems.</div><div>🏠 UBS ensures access to housing, food, healthcare, and education—directly addressing root issues.</div><div>📉 UBI can create inflation, UBS builds stability.</div><div>🚀 UBS removes barriers to success without discouraging ambition.</div><div><br></div><div>We don’t need to just give people money—we need to ensure they have the tools to build a future.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>2. What Does Universal Basic Security Guarantee?</div><div><br></div><div>🔹 Housing Security – Every Australian has a safe place to live—not necessarily extravagant, but secure, functional, and dignified.</div><div>🔹 Food Security – No Australian should go hungry. Local food programs, sustainable agriculture, and nutritional assistance will be prioritized.</div><div>🔹 Healthcare Security – Free, universal healthcare must be expanded to cover mental health, dental, and vision care.</div><div>🔹 Education Security – A future where all learning is free, including university, trade schools, and AI-driven education.</div><div>🔹 Energy Security – No one should have to choose between food and electricity. Essential utilities will be guaranteed at a basic level.</div><div><br></div><div>These are not privileges—they are the foundation of a functioning society.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>3. How Will Universal Basic Security Be Funded?</div><div><br></div><div>👑 The monarch government already has the funds to implement this.</div><div>💰 Redirect excessive corporate subsidies to UBS initiatives.</div><div>🏦 Reform tax loopholes for billion-dollar corporations.</div><div>⚡ Invest in AI and automation to reduce inefficiencies in government spending.</div><div><br></div><div>The money already exists—it’s just being spent in the wrong places.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>4. How Will This Impact Australia’s Future?</div><div><br></div><div>🔹 Crime rates will drop—because no one is forced into desperation.</div><div>🔹 Innovation will flourish—because people are free to create without fear of poverty.</div><div>🔹 The economy will strengthen—because when people are secure, they can spend, invest, and contribute.</div><div>🔹 Mental health will improve—because survival stress will no longer dominate people’s lives.</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just about helping the poor—this is about building a stronger, fairer Australia for all.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>5. The People Must Demand UBS</div><div><br></div><div>The People’s Presidency does not have the funds to implement this alone. But we have the power of knowledge and collective demand.</div><div><br></div><div>📢 If we spread this idea, if we make enough noise, the government will be forced to listen.</div><div><br></div><div>🚀 This is how change begins—not from the top down, but from the people up.</div><div><br></div><div>We must push this message until it becomes undeniable. The more Australians who understand Universal Basic Security, the harder it will be for the system to ignore us.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Final Thought – A Future Where No One Is Left Behind</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine an Australia where no one has to fight for survival.</div><div>Imagine a future where every citizen has the tools to build a meaningful life.</div><div>Imagine a world where government exists to provide security, not control.</div><div><br></div><div>🔥 This is the future we are fighting for.</div><div>🔥 This is what the People’s Presidency stands for.</div><div>🔥 Together, we can make Universal Basic Security a reality.</div><div><br></div><div>🔗 Join the movement: wendellsdiary.com</div>
