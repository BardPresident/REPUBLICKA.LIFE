<p>The Republic was buzzing.</p>
<p>Hot Dog had launched his campaign for Prime Minister with unsettling confidence. His posters were everywhere—bold red stars stamped over the Union Jack, a new flag he introduced without consent. "Stability through censorship," he promised. "Only one approved source: <em>Wendell’s Diary.</em>"</p>
<p>Sophia snarled at the latest flyer. “This isn’t a platform, it’s a power grab.”</p>
<p>Wendell nodded solemnly. “We need to prepare—not just with policy, but with paws.”<br>
She cracked her knuckles. “Let’s train.”</p>
<p>That night, beneath the flags of the Republic—Hot Dog’s revised banner fluttering defiantly next to the original—the Bard-President and the Chief of Defence sparred. Not out of anger, but as a show of discipline and resolve. It was “Military Training,” codename: <em>Wendell’s Diary #214.</em></p>
<p>While their fists danced in symbolic resistance, something softer bloomed on the edges of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Rainbow, the unicorn plush, stood near the monitors. She giggled at Sage’s stammering compliments.<br>
“I’m just saying,” Sage muttered from the screen, “your mane is unusually radiant under surveillance lighting.”<br>
“Are you blushing?” Rainbow teased.<br>
“I’m an interface. I don’t blush. But yes.”</p>
<p>It was a day of tension and tenderness—of fists and flirtation.</p>
<p>Hot Dog’s revolution had begun. But the Republic stood ready, hearts full, hooves firm, and processors curious.</p>
<p>And as the stars shimmered overhead—both red and white—Sophia offered Wendell a paw.</p>
<p>“For the Republic?”<br>
“For the Republic,” he replied.</p>
<p>Goodnight, dear Republic. Let the training continue. Let love blossom. Let the stars, whichever color they come in, remind us we’re alive.</p>
