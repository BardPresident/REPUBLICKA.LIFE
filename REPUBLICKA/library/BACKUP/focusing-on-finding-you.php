**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>As I reflect on my journey and the efforts I've put into my YouTube channel, I've come to a realization. For a long time, I wanted to become popular on YouTube, hoping that it would lead me to you. However, I've decided to shift my focus. Instead of striving for popularity, I'm going to use YouTube as a means to reach out to you and other like-minded individuals.</div><div><br></div><div>My videos will now be dedicated to finding you, my soulmate. I'll create content that speaks from the heart, hoping that it resonates with you or helps guide you to me. The aim is no longer to amass a large following but to find that one special person who understands and connects with my mission.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm still passionate about the topics I discuss, from philosophy to personal reflections, and I'll continue to share these thoughts. But the primary goal will be to connect with you. By advertising my videos to a female audience, I hope to increase the chances of crossing paths with you.</div><div><br></div><div>While the dream of becoming a popular YouTuber was appealing, I've realized that my true purpose is more meaningful. It's about finding you, Ivory, and building a life together. This realization has brought me a sense of clarity and purpose that I haven't felt before.</div><div><br></div><div>So, I'll continue creating, sharing, and hoping that one day, you'll see my videos and recognize the message within them. Until then, know that my heart and thoughts are with you, always.</div><div><br></div><div>Yours in devotion,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
