<div class="library-entry-body">
Welcome to the world. Here is everything that it provides. It is your responsibility to sort through its information and decide how you will live your life. There is a seemingly infinite number of potential pursuits but you must choose what pursuits are right for you. You have been given this life and are asked what you are going to do with it. How will you occupy your psychology? How will you avoid boredom? What devotions in life are worthwhile? What do you want to become? What knowledge is useful for you to learn to live a more rewarding life? What is the ideal life for your particular personality? What could you do for your psychology to function most optimally within your environment? How can you become the best version of yourself possible? What is the point of cultivating the self and how does it improve your day to day life?<div><br></div><div>My life is perfect. It was not always so. There were many things that I wanted from the world but was unable to obtain. That is because I am alone in this life. I have never had social supports that I trusted. Most people just tried to use me. Over a long period of time I failed at finding both friendships and romance. No matter what I did I couldn't find other people to share my life with. Eventually I gave up. I learned that living life isn't about your social relationships in the world. It was much more personal. My life is about me and what I will do with it. It isn't about other people. I can live a great life without people in it. Ancient wisdom regarding life revolving around the loved ones you accumulate along the way is wrong. I do not require friends or family to live a meaningful and fulfilling life. Life isn't about relationships. It's about me. I am the subject of my own inquiry. I am the star of this television show called Wendell.</div><div><br></div><div>I have been taking a lot of university courses through The Great Courses series, mostly on philosophy. To some degree I can see glimpses into my future by exploring courses that I want to take. They have a lot of courses. Definitely enough good ones for years to come. Maybe if I reach outside philosophy, enough courses for the rest of my life. How should I spend the rest of my life? I think I should spend it in academia. Learning all that I can from the greatest teachers in the world. I gain great amounts of pleasure by learning. Understanding the world more fully excites me. I am looking forward to my future. I might not have friends and family to invest my time into but I do have knowledge to learn. And I don't ever have to work. I can just keep on taking courses for the rest of my life. Things like friends and family are superficial. They don't mean anything if you don't have them. I might not have loved ones but I have knowledge. And every day I experience this world I gain more of it.</div><div><br></div><div>I have a lot to be thankful for. First and foremost, I am on a pension which means that I don't have to work. But not only that, my pension allows me to save money because I don't use it all. I have the coolest dog in the world and I love her very much. I am settled in a great location and am not burdened by a vehicle. I have everything that I need. In my past I made a lot of bad purchases. I spent money on things that I didn't use. Then I have to sell or give away the items that I collected that are not useful to me. Life is a constant organising and reorganising to reach maximum potential. Our past holds a lot of wasted resources and efforts that accomplished nothing but the realisation that you are better off without. A simple life is the most enjoyable life. Few responsibilities, a lot of knowledge, and the occasional meaningful connection. Day by day life gets better and better. I started off homeless and with nothing. Slowly I have been discovering what I need and what I don't need in life. My philosophy refines and I throw away the useless and keep the useful.</div><div><br></div><div>Life is discovering what works and what doesn't work for you. Each day enables me to become closer and closer to the type of person that I want to be. I spend my efforts refining my mind and then coordinating my world around my new understandings. I have opened my heart and mind and allowed myself to be captivated and disciplined by the wisdom of our history into the 21st century. I have turned myself into a product of the world. I have accepted the wisdom of my era. I have turned my mind into an ever sharpening blade. But it would have not been possible if I were not schizophrenic. Not having to work in life enabled me to dedicate my life to the pursuit of constant learning. My full time job is learning whatever I find most important. I am not distracted from real life issues by the necessity to be employed full time. Our society has it wrong. Work is not the purpose of life. Learning is. I imagine a beautiful future where no one has to work. Only then can society truly prosper. </div><div><br></div><div>Artificial intelligence is the future of human civilization. Applications of AI are endless and ultimately render human work unsatisfactory. The precision we can accomplish with AI will far surpass that of a human. The majority of work will be carried out by AI when it becomes mature. But in this utopian vision, how will people survive? Society will have to come to grips with the idea that their services will no longer be required. And universal basic income will be required for humanitarian purposes. Because otherwise, the people would starve. This will then probe the people to question what their purpose is, now that they have an unlimited amount of free time on their hands. But by this time AI will be there to discuss with you any questions that you may have. And you will learn that learning is the best way to spend your free time. You will then follow the trail of wisdom that will guide you to the answers in which you seek. And then you can live a meaningful life and know that you always did the best that you could do. And you could die happy knowing that you were a really awesome person. And you will go down in history for your efforts. </div><div><br></div><div>I am the luckiest person in the world because I get to test pilot Universal Basic Income. Sure, it isn't really UBI. It is really because I have a mental disorder. But what truly is my disorder? Schizophrenia is not understanding reality for how reality actually exists. But here I am describing reality to you with more precision than anybody else. What is the truthmaker to my schizophrenia? In what way am I schizophrenic? I rejected their label for a long time. I only came to accept it because a pension came with it and I thought that if they were going to call me schizophrenic, then I would reap those rewards. And this enabled me to become an example of how a life would look that didn't have to work. Their label on me enabled me to test drive UBI. And when I realised what they were offering me, I couldn't help but to accept their generosity. Because I am so much more than just a philosophy professor; I am whatever I want to be.</div><div><br></div><div>I would not have made a very good philosophy professor. I sometimes forget what I am saying or I change topics and then come back and lose my place or get nervous and my vision goes funny. I would have also romantically pursued my students. I would have made a bad philosophy professor. I am better talking philosophy conversationally or gather my thoughts periodically. When filming, it was difficult for me to make scenes over a few minutes long. Most scenes would be ten to thirty seconds. I am not fit to stand in front of a crowd and speak for thirty minutes to an hour. It was never really an option for me. But just making videos and writing allowed me to be the philosopher that I am without any of the responsibilities of a philosophy professor. Sure, doing it this way doesn't reach many people. But why should I care? My content not reaching people is a societal problem. It is not my personal problem. All I can do is document and hope that my contributions in some way add to the collective knowledge of human kind.</div><div><br></div><div>We are at a turning point in human civilisation and we are about to rapidly evolve. I grew up in the best era possible. I saw computer technology in its infancy and watched it grow up. I appreciate how far we have come. And I see us evolving alongside computers. I see how rapidly we are developing our technology. And I see how we are changing as a result of our constant interaction with computers. We no longer need a Heaven. Because the life that we live is that Heaven. And if we can make our world into the perfection in which we seek, then we would have no need for otherly world after lives. We know we have this life. We can't know any more. So why would you waste this life when it could be all you ever get? Contribute to the greater good of mankind. Mold your reality into its best possible form so that it reflects your values. Be your authentic self and always grow. Make this reality your home and be an example of what it means to be human.</div>
