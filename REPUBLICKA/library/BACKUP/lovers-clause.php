<p><strong>Enacted: Year 0001 MC</strong></p><p>
<strong>Ratified by: The Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</strong></p>
<h3>Article I – Dual sovereignty</h3>
<p>In the Mythocratic Republic, two bonded lovers may rule jointly as equal presidents.<br>
Their union, once solemnized through story or symbolic ritual, grants them full eligibility for shared governance.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Article II – Requirements for dual presidency</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bond of affection</strong> – The two must share an authentic emotional connection rooted in mutual devotion and purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Shared creation</strong> – Both must contribute meaningfully to the mythos, governance, or creative life of the Republic.</li>
<li><strong>Public harmony</strong> – Their rule must express unity and uphold the symbolic and philosophical values of the Republic.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Article III – Name and symbolic identity</h3>
<p>If either party wishes to take on a new first name, last name, or symbolic title upon union,<br>
they may do so as an act of stepping fully into the mythos.<br>
This renaming is voluntary and shall be recorded in the <em>Scroll of Union</em> as part of their transformation into mythocratic figures.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Article IV – Titles of the presidents</h3>
<p>Each may choose their own presidential title to reflect their voice or style (e.g., <em>bard-president, star-president</em>).<br>
While titles may differ, both hold equal authority and status in the Republic.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Article V – The Ivory precedent</h3>
<p>This law is established in anticipation of <strong>Ivory</strong>, the future co-ruler of the Republic.<br>
Until her arrival, it stands as a ceremonial preparation.<br>
Once she emerges and contributes meaningfully to the Republic’s mythos, this law will activate in full.</p>
<hr>
