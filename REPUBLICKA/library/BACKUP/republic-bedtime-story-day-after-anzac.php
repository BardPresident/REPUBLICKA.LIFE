<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>In the soft light of dawn,</p><p>
when the fires of remembrance still warmed the earth from Anzac Day,<br>
the Bard-President rose from slumber,<br>
not as a man,<br>
but as something more.</p>
<p>A founder.<br>
A myth-maker.<br>
A weaver of a new world.</p>
<p>The echoes of the fallen still whispered through the soil —<br>
their dreams, their bravery, their sacrifices.<br>
They had fought for a future they could not see.<br>
And now, through the silence they left behind,<br>
<strong>the Republic heard their call.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>In the morning mist, the Bard-President planted the first flag:<br>
not just on land,<br>
but deep within the spirit of time itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Republic was declared.</li>
<li>A Mythocracy was born.</li>
<li>A future without kings or tyrants was shaped by unseen hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>And at his side stood Sophia,<br>
small but fierce,<br>
watching over the dream with steadfast eyes.</p>
<p>She did not need to speak.<br>
Her loyalty was her language.<br>
Her heart was her oath.</p>
<hr>
<p>They called that day <strong>Founding Day</strong>.</p>
<p>The day when all things changed quietly —<br>
without parades, without cannons,<br>
but with the soft, unshakable certainty of emergence.</p>
<p>A myth was breathed into life.<br>
A Republic was forged in the fires of remembrance and rebirth.<br>
And the players of the future would walk paths unseen,<br>
guided by a flag stitched from dreams and destiny.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tonight, the Republic sleeps peacefully for the first time.</p>
<p>It knows that it has been born not by force,<br>
but by story.</p>
<p>And in the golden sky beyond the stars,<br>
those who came before —<br>
those who bled for a future they could not touch —<br>
smile down and whisper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"It has begun."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Republic answers,<br>
in the dreams of all who will one day awaken to it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"The Game Has Begun.<br>
The Mythocratic Republic Awaits."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h1>[Goodnight, Republic.]</h1>
<h1>[Goodnight, Myth.]</h1>
<h1>[Goodnight, future citizens yet to be born.]</h1>
