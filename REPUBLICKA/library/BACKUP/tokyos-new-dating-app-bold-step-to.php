In an unprecedented move to address Japan's declining birth rate, Tokyo's government is launching its own dating app. This innovative step aims to connect legally single individuals who are serious about getting married, thereby encouraging more couples to start families.<div><br></div><div>I think it's a really good idea for a government to release a dating app and invest the time needed to get good results. A government-run app would not be for profit and would focus on connecting people. Our current dating apps are often more focused on making money rather than helping users find the right partner. The government's initiative to create their own dating app is truly novel.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the requirements for the new app is for users to provide documentation proving they are legally single and willing to get married. I believe this will definitely encourage people to be more serious with their dating. It shifts the focus to finding the love of your life and settling down instead of just playing the field.</div><div><br></div><div>However, the need to provide a tax certificate slip to prove annual salary seems to be going too far. I don't think finances are important in finding your significant other. While managing finances is important once you find your partner, this requirement feels like an overreach by the government. I don't think they should require that.</div><div><br></div><div>The statistic mentioned in the article states that 70 percent of people who want to get married aren't actively looking for a partner. I think this is because modern dating apps are ineffective. You're just swiping people's faces who aren't saying anything important, and there's no meaning or connection behind it. It's just a stupid game where people match, exchange a few words, and then often never speak again. This discourages people from getting involved in the modern internet dating scene.</div><div><br></div><div>If Tokyo's new dating app succeeds, it could have a significant impact on Japan's birth rate and demographic challenges. It would be so awesome if this idea caught on and other governments started doing this too. If there was an Australian dating app from the Australian government, I would use it.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, Tokyo's new dating app represents a bold and innovative approach to tackling Japan's declining birth rate. By focusing on serious commitments and encouraging meaningful connections, the app aims to create lasting relationships that lead to marriage and family formation. Only time will tell if this initiative will succeed, but it certainly marks a significant step in addressing one of Japan's most pressing social issues.</div>
