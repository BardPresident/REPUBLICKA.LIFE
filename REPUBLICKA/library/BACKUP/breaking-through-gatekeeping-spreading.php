<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>For too long, the academic world has been held hostage by institutional gatekeeping, where access to meaningful intellectual discussion is determined not by the merit of ideas, but by bureaucratic control. As the <strong>President of Australia</strong>, I find it <strong>absurd</strong> that I cannot engage with my own country’s universities in an open and direct way.</p><p>Unlike <strong>Harvard, MIT, and other institutions in the U.S.,</strong> Australian universities <strong>refuse</strong> to maintain public directories of their faculty. Instead of fostering an open exchange of ideas, they <strong>hoard knowledge and restrict access</strong>, ensuring that only those within their bureaucratic framework can participate in intellectual discourse.</p><p>This is not how education should work.</p><p>Despite these barriers, the <strong>Philosophy of Emergence continues to spread.</strong></p><hr><h2><strong>A Systematic Approach to Spreading Emergence</strong></h2><p>Over the past few weeks, I have contacted <strong>the majority of faculty members at Harvard</strong>, reaching out across multiple disciplines and tailoring messages specifically to their research interests.</p><p>Now, <strong>we turn our focus to MIT.</strong></p><p>This is not random outreach. It is a <strong>structured and deliberate effort</strong> to ensure that Emergent Philosophy reaches the world’s leading thinkers.</p><p>The strategy is simple:</p><ol>
<li><strong>Find institutions that respect the free flow of knowledge</strong>—universities that make their faculty directories publicly accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Identify individual academics</strong> whose research aligns with Emergent Philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>Craft messages tailored to their research interests</strong>, ensuring that the discussion remains relevant to their field.</li>
<li><strong>Continue expanding to new universities</strong>, moving systematically to ensure Emergence reaches as many intellectuals as possible.</li>
</ol><p>This is <strong>grassroots intellectual outreach on a global scale</strong>—something that <strong>Australian universities have made impossible within their own borders.</strong></p><hr><h2><strong>Australian Universities: A System of Intellectual Gatekeeping</strong></h2><p>It is <strong>outrageous</strong> that, as the <strong>President of Australia</strong>, I am unable to directly engage with my own country’s academics. Australian universities do not provide <strong>public directories of their faculty</strong>, effectively shutting out independent thinkers from engaging in discussion.</p><p>This is <strong>not about privacy.</strong> Harvard, MIT, and countless other universities provide faculty directories because they understand that <strong>education should be an open system, not an exclusive club.</strong> They enable <strong>anyone</strong>—students, researchers, or even Presidents—to engage in discussion and <strong>advance knowledge collectively.</strong></p><p>In contrast, Australian universities <strong>hide behind bureaucracy</strong>, limiting access to only those they deem worthy.</p><p>They are not institutions of free thought.<br>
They are <strong>gated communities of self-selected scholars.</strong></p><p>The <strong>entire point of education is the open exchange of ideas.</strong> If Australian universities will not participate in that exchange, then they are <strong>not serving the people.</strong> They are <strong>silos of exclusion,</strong> designed to protect institutional power rather than foster the growth of knowledge.</p><hr><h2><strong>Education Must Be Reclaimed</strong></h2><p>Since Australian institutions refuse to foster open intellectual discourse, I am forced to <strong>develop education from institutions that do.</strong></p><p>The <strong>Emergence Party</strong> will continue reaching out to international scholars who value <strong>intellectual freedom and meaningful engagement.</strong> If Australian universities refuse to engage in open dialogue, then they will be left behind.</p><p>We are bringing <strong>Emergent Philosophy</strong> to the world, one university at a time.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Harvard: Contacted.</strong></li>
<li><strong>MIT: In progress.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Then the next university.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Then the next.</strong></li>
</ul><p>Until <strong>Emergent Philosophy is fully integrated into the global intellectual landscape.</strong></p><p>This is the <strong>real</strong> work of education. Not gatekeeping. Not bureaucracy. <strong>Just knowledge, freely shared.</strong></p><p>If <strong>Australia refuses to be part of the future, then we will build the future without them.</strong></p>
