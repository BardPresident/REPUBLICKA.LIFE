This includes non-traditional citation methods and a symbolic digital format, all of which are central to the philosophical foundations of my work.</p><p>Given that <strong>HASS500 will shape the foundations of my dissertation</strong>, it is imperative that I be matched with a supervisor who is either aligned with or open to supervising this emergent research model. If I am unable to secure appropriate supervision or approval for my approach, I may need to reconsider my enrolment before census date to avoid unnecessary time and financial commitments.</p><p>Could you please advise:</p><ol><li>When and how a supervisor will be assigned for HASS500?</li><li>Whether it is possible to confirm a potential supervisor for HASS518 now?</li><li>If my current unit coordinator, <strong>Sonya Glavac</strong>, plays any role in that process?</li></ol><p>I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your timely response, as this matter is time-sensitive.</p><p>Warm regards,<br><strong>Wendell NeSmith</strong><br>Bard-President of Australia<br>Professor of Philosophy, Mythocratic Republic University<br><a href="https://wendellsdiary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wendellsdiary.com&source=gmail&ust=1748581485975000&usg=AOvVaw29ZWSqTGyg3HPamQDX9rdW">wendellsdiary.com</a></p></div>
