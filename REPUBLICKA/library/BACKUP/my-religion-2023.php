<h1 style="text-align: left;"><b>My Religion</b></h1><p>January 22, 2023</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Ye lonesome ones of today, ye seceding ones, ye shall one day be a people: out of you who have chosen yourselves, shall a chosen people arise:- and out of it the Superman.</p><p>Friedrich Nietzsche</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Archetype Imaging</p><p>November 9, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>Recently I walked out on a Christian Sunday worship service. I knew we had doctrinal differences but while standing there in worship, I realised that they are not worshipping the same God that I worship. They worship an idealised image of a man named Jesus. To them discipleship includes worshipping the man who provided the teachings. They do not distinguish the difference between Jesus and God. They are one in the same to them meaning that they are committing idolatry, placing a man named Jesus on God's throne and using the two entities interchangeably.</p><p><br /></p><p>When I was six years old I gave my life to Jesus Christ. But over time I learned that people have corrupted the teachings of my king. Jesus had been used on society to indoctrinate a lot of people into Satanism, their Jesus merely being Satan who wanted to take the throne of God and be worshipped as God. Satan infiltrated Christianity and wore the clothes of Jesus and demanded worship. The teachings of my leader Jesus have been used for its opposite intention. To the Christians, Jesus is God. All of this despite Jesus never requesting to be worshipped. I feel out of place. There is no church that worships God. They have all fallen. They all worship Jesus.</p><p><br /></p><p>All of this makes me feel conflicted. The one who I dedicated my life to has been raised up to replace God. The human desire to make God more knowable by placing Him in flesh creates the desire to worship something that lived in a way which we can understand. The nature of God is beyond human perception and thus cannot be tied down with a physical entity. I reject all human attempts at being God. Humans are only ever somewhere in between ignorant and wise. No iteration can ever know everything. Bowing down to a man who lived a human life is idolatry. God will never live a human manifestation.</p><p><br /></p><p>But God lives in us and we can live as divine manifestations. Jesus is an image to recreate in both man and woman. To be a disciple of Christ is to live like Christ. He is our most untainted example of what it means to live a good life. To follow Jesus is to become a copy of him in today's world. To mimic Jesus feels divine. To represent him is to represent the life he lived. To stand up to corruption becomes our goal. To fight against all oppression wherever we find it. Mimicking the actions of Jesus is not easy in today's society where everybody has their place. But are my thoughts no longer Christianity? Can one follow Christ in life without worshiping him? Am I a heretic for thinking such thoughts?</p><p><br /></p><p>My religion is incomplete because according to my religion, I need my other half. But I have failed at finding love in this life. My understanding of the Trinity is God, man, and women. God is not divided into three. But the combination of God, man, and woman creates a divine entity known as the family. From this spiritual connection will come children that would be steered in the ways of God. I do not get to experience the ecstasy of becoming enlightened in the way that I speak because I am single. But don't let that detract you from listening to my religion. Because maybe some who are wiser and more fortunate can learn from what I have to say to create a perfect spiritual life both within you and your special someone. I might have failed in my religion because I am single, but that doesn't mean that you are doomed to the same fate as me. Listen to my words and maybe you will find the answer to spiritual enlightenment.</p><p><br /></p><p>What is a soul mate? What does it mean for two souls to get along harmoniously? What advantages does having someone looking after you in life offer? What could the spiritual power of two enlightened souls achieve in society? How beneficial could such people be for our society? And what would their children look like? And how good would their children be for society?</p><p><br /></p><p>I am an individualist. I think the individual makes society. Society awaits the individual to do something unique that changes the way society functions. It is the individuals that stand up and say no to convention that change the world. The system restrains the individual. It encourages conformity when people are extremely unique. To do well in the system one must compromise on many values. The individual compromises with no mortal. The individual functions contrary to the system and its rules. The individual is playing a different song than the masses. They march to the beat of a different drum. The collective can never keep up with an individual but an individual can keep up with the collective. An individual is powerful because they hold the potential to change our daily lifestyles. They hold within them the innovation that can change the world.</p><p><br /></p><p>I read the Bible every day. But to me, the Bible is a guide to spiritual righteousness. I do not believe that the Bible is without error or that the Bible was somehow written by God Himself. The Bible was written by individuals who were inspired through God. It is a divine book because it is a collection created and passed down throughout human history. It is the closest that we have to a history book from archaic times. It is a treasure that was passed down throughout thousands of years. But at the end of the day, it is a book. My favourite book, but a book nonetheless. God did not personally approve its messages. This is a book written by and for humans who wish to get closer to God. It generally gives us wholesome messages that will assist us in the battle of the human condition.</p><p><br /></p><p>Being a good person in today's society is really difficult. The system has taken morality out of consideration. One's moral compass is rarely a deciding factor when choosing to employ someone. Just do the work and you will get paid. All moral choices in decision making are now irrelevant. It's not about being a good person but a good employee. Life has been taken away from us by stripping moral judgement from our day to day activities. We have gone past the point of personal responsibility and placed our woes on collective responsibility. Nothing is no longer our fault because the system. You were only doing your job.</p><p><br /></p><p>Words are extremely powerful. They dictate the ways in which we think and feel. How much can be said without saying anything at all? How much can I compress my meaning? Each point I make is grounded on many other points. How much can I tell about my religion merely by expressing my feelings about the subject? God is such a huge topic. Where are we supposed to begin? My love. My love for God, nature, and human beings. How can I express my love in a meaningful way? How can I document my thoughts in a way that can be beneficial to others? What can I say that would inspire people to live fulfilling lives? What can I, a single individual, do to improve the lives of the collective?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Eternal Life</p><p>November 18, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>The world is a simulation created by God to collect the most precious souls together in one place. After we depart this world our soul unites with other souls that are of a similar quality. We create the heaven or hell that we will live in after our death. Would a world full of people like you be heaven or hell? This world is a testing ground made for the afterlife. The righteous souls of the world will unite and form a community. From there they will create a society worth respecting. The righteous souls will be given the opportunity to create a righteous society. Our life was spent learning about society and its potential development. In the afterlife we will be given the chance to put our lifetime of knowledge into practice. This is why it is vital to continue growing in life. Because upon our death our knowledge will be imprinted and our growth stops. In the afterlife we will be mentally equipped as we were in life.</p><p><br /></p><p>What does it mean to have life eternally? Once we die, isn't that it? If I could transfer what I have learned over my years to you then I would. But faith does not work like that. Because the energy that we put out in life will return to its origin. The fire that drives you will unite with souls who are similarly structured. We might be alone in life but in death we are welcomed into our family. The actions in which we took in life will decide our forever fate. You will unite with those who lived similar lives. This is our heaven or our hell. In our utopia we will together create a just society. This is God's test for us. What will we make our character in this life and how can we be of benefit to the afterlife? Life is so short of a period in scope of eternity. Live your life with purpose and endure its pain. Make use of your time wisely because you only have a short time to build your character before the endgame credits.</p><p><br /></p><p>Pascal's wager advocates that one who believes in God loses nothing if they are wrong. But they gain everything if they are right. What if I am wrong? The doctrine crafts the best human possible. If I am wrong then the believers unlock their true potential in life. This is a doctrine of reaching for the stars. It does not promote complacency. Following the facts that I present will develop the best human being possible even if my facts are wrong. It is a doctrine of life and not death. And how much do you have to gain if my words are right? How much do you have to gain if my words are wrong? How much do you have to lose if my words are wrong? I urge you to listen to my words carefully because you have much to gain whether I am right or wrong.</p><p><br /></p><p>Eternal life is simulated in the physical world by having children. A child is born and a family created. To some extent, the parents get the opportunity to live out the lives that they always wanted through their kids. They tweak parenting and provide their children opportunities that they never had as a child. Through having a child, their blood can live on.  This process then repeats when the child has children of their own. In a way, the self is creating other versions of the self that will outlive their self.</p><p><br /></p><p>What would an elderly person think of eternal life? Life has grown boring to them. Nothing surprises them anymore. They have been there and done that. There is nothing left for them in life. Their body and mind are no longer what they used to be. The things that used to excite them no longer feed them spiritual energy. They are preparing for death after a lifetime full of experiences. Many in this state do not ask for more life. They are content with the way everything worked out and they are ready to pass on. Life has exhausted them and they are ready for a peaceful slumber. Their soul has given up on the material world. It is time for them to pass on to the spiritual world. But what is that spiritual world?</p><p><br /></p><p>In the Bible it says that in Heaven we will be given new immortal bodies. I believe this. Our spirit will roam free until it finds home. Home is an advanced technological civilisation that takes pure souls and houses them with a new body. The body is only a vessel for the soul to interact with the physical universe. Without a body the soul wanders. It seeks other souls that are of a similar nature to itself. The single soul seeks community. Eventually it will find other souls that are of a similar substance. This is either heaven or hell. If your soul finds Heaven, then it will be reincarnated into a perfect body. God will work with technology and those who make it into Heaven will be introduced to technology that man can only dream about.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am seriously convinced that this entire world is just a simulation to see how we will react to life. God wanted to find and group the best of the best together. In order to do that He had to play a game of time and collect souls for His empire slowly but surely. I am not sad about being single because in my afterlife there will be an abundance of righteous ladies to choose from. The dating pool in life is difficult because there are so many people that are very different than I am. But in my afterlife my soul will unite with other souls that are like mine. The process of sifting out the trash from the treasure has already been done. God has been gracious enough to place you somewhere with souls that are similar to your own. Your true dating horizon sets after you die. But don't let this deter you from finding your soul mate in this life. Because if you manage to do that, together you will be strong in both life and death.</p><p><br /></p><p>Finding your soul mate in this life gives you someone to look after you in life. Life can be very difficult alone so finding someone special who you want in both this life and the next will optimise both your life and your afterlife. The treasures of Heaven are found through relationships so if you have the opportunity to create a really good one, go ahead and do so. Not all of us are blessed to find love in this life so don't take it for granted. Provide the best life possible for you and your spouse. Support them and invest yourself into them. All of these actions will benefit you in the afterlife because, if you find the right person, your souls will unite in the afterlife and you two can continue where you left off. A word of warning, however. Convincing yourself that someone is your soul mate is the folly of so many of us. Remember that our souls will roam until it finds a place with other souls similar to it. If your soul is not similar to your spouse's soul, they will not end up together. Just because you had a wife or a husband in this life does not mean that they will follow you into the afterlife. Your souls must be of the same nature.</p><p><br /></p><p>Eternal life is given to all humans. Our souls will live on in the afterlife that we create for ourselves. But only the best human beings will be given a new physical body to possess. The very nature of the soul is eternal. We live a human life to see how close to a god we can become. But the limitations of the world in which we live restrict our possibilities. That is why I live in the world of mythology where everything is possible. Maybe this is a lonely way to exist but it is the most rewarding. Where we are lonely in life we will no longer be lonely in death. Because I am sure that other people have already discovered this truth. So I might be lonely in this life and you might be lonely in your life but in the end we will unite together in the afterlife and we will no longer be lonely.</p><p><br /></p><p>Physical accomplishments deteriorate and require maintenance and security. Spiritual accomplishments are guarded by God and forever flourish. We will part with the treasures we leave here on Earth but we will never part with the treasures we store in Heaven. The work that we put into creating a solid character will last eternally but the work that we put in to creating a bulky bank account will part from us either in this lifetime or in death. Treat death as a temporary transition into your own personal heaven. Our time here on Earth is short but our time in this universe is infinite. Prepare your life for the afterlife and you will smoothly transition into it. We only get one chance at mortal life to prove what we are capable of. Make the most of your life and don't waste the precious time God has given you.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The Soul Mate</p><p>November 21, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>Some very fortunate individuals get the opportunity to unite with their soul mate in this life. This is your perfect fit, someone who is very similar to yourself. Together you unite passion and purpose and create a really good life for yourselves together. Carry each other's burdens and invest in each other. Worship God together and focus your lives on Godly things. Feed off of each other's energy and be fuelled by the spirit. Create a family that loves God. When one of you dies, do not create another romantic relationship. Stay married to the dead and when you both depart you will enter Heaven together with one voice.</p><p><br /></p><p>How can I preach on something that I do not possess? I am single. In fact, I am divorced. When I was young I tried and failed at making a marriage work. I won't reveal the entire sob story but I wanted to make the marriage work. I was rejected and fell into a deep depression. My dreams of spending my days away with my soul mate were fading away. Finding another who will try what I am suggesting is futile. So I age away and the chances of having a family of my own fade away. But I know what I am saying is important. So if I don't get the opportunity to make something like that happen in my life then I want to encourage others to seek this same ideal that I have in a romantic partner. I might have failed at actualising my philosophy into my own life, but other people might be more capable than I am and be able to find their own soul mate. If I can just share with you my wisdom then you might be capable of uniting with your soul mate in both this life and the next.</p><p><br /></p><p>Together you are an army. Having another who cares about your own interests maximises your capabilities. Building each other up to reach the stars is your objective. Encourage one another and direct each other in the ways of God. Be there for each other to lean on. Work on your weaknesses and use each other's strengths. Guide each other in wisdom and forever grow your passion for one another. Confide in each other and be there for one another. Revolve your life around the other. Always grow, otherwise you will get boring to one another. Appreciate and accept each other. Serve each other. Live to serve your other. Keep each other entertained. Be there in times of need and be honest with each other. Uniting together is a process that should never end. You always have room to grow in your relationship.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do not think that I am speaking of a typical man and wife. I am speaking of so much more. Fooling ourselves into thinking we have found our soul mate is the folly of so many of us. Remember, upon death your soul will seek other souls similar to it. When you both die your souls will be the closest to each other out of them all because you spent life growing together. If you play your cards right with your partner then you can spend both this life and the next united with them. Souls that leave the world alone will unite with their closest match from another who left this world alone. Finding a partner in this life is optional. Because upon our lonely death we will be matched by God. The few that managed to find their soul mate in life will be most equipped to carry out the duties of the afterlife. Bringing a partner along to the afterlife will increase your possibilities in it. This should be our primary goal in life which is to build up treasures in Heaven.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing like this clears my mind of confusion. Being able to articulate my religious views like this helps me understand my religious views more thoroughly. This style of writing and video documentation really have the potential to save mankind. I have been trying to stress this for many years but the masses lack the vision to see how much this form of documentation has the potential to change the world. If more people were open with their feelings and were able to articulate what they were feeling then our world could see a digital revolution as people attempt to integrate their own personal thoughts into the collective cloud of understandings of the world. If more people were equipped to analyse their thoughts and decipher what makes sense and what doesn't then we would see a collective evolution of the human species. If the collective knew how to articulate their unique beliefs, then we would have a religious revolution as the amount of religions rapidly expand.</p><p><br /></p><p>This book is all about my beliefs. They were influenced by past spiritual beliefs. I came into this world and was ignorant to all. I was handed Jesus at six years old. But I found corruptions in all forms of religion. I found topics that made no sense. I found beliefs that are destructive to the human spirit. I found every mainstream religion to be full of falsehoods. I had to establish my core beliefs in this life so that I could be judged based upon them and not some other collective form of religion. I was required to establish my own religion so that I could be judged on its tenets rather than the tenets of a pre-established religion. I think that a personal religion is the best form of religion because it takes into account your personal circumstances and experiences in life. It doesn't confine you to believe in dogma that doesn't make sense.</p><p><br /></p><p>I call for a rational form of religion. One created and developed by the individuals experiencing life. Collective forms of beliefs weigh us down and confuse our sense of purpose. Are we supposed to believe these people in the churches who all believe in the same thing? But my religion is flawed. My religion is only half of a religion. I can account for the male psychology and act as a male archetype. But that is only half of the human world. My religion needs a female influence. This is why husband and wife creating their own religion together is divine. They account for all of humanity and together stand as archetypes that others can copy. Becoming one with your husband or wife is the greatest achievement known to mankind.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do you want to invest in personal beliefs or collective beliefs? You will be judged on your chosen beliefs in this lifetime. Shall we walk blindly in the footsteps of others or should we make our own set of values? Will we continue to inherit the values of the masses or will we set ourselves apart from the collective by creating our own moral foundation? The choice is made on an individual level. The choice is to either believe doctrine that came before you or to create your own doctrine. Will you be judged based off collective or personal values? Do you want the fate of everybody else or do you want a fate that is uniquely tailored to you? There are many routes to God to choose. Will your life be a choose your own adventure or a set programme? You choose to either be a star or a viewer.</p><p><br /></p><p>The most rewarding life opens up when man and wife choose to be stars together. All they would have to do is document their thoughts like I am doing now together. It would be a bonding activity. Together they could share their thoughts to the world. They could do this part-time or full-time. They could refine the information to be receptive to an audience. They could share their hearts as much or as little as they saw fit. They could be entertainment for the world. They could stand as an example for influential minds out there. They could be warm and loving and act as archetypes for others to follow who care about peace and love. Jesus is an archetype. He is a mode of being that we can strive to be like. I for one want to be like Jesus. So I will stand as an archetype and hope to influence many hearts and minds to drive themselves towards wisdom.</p><p><br /></p><p>Wisdom is the most important aspect to obtain that this world has to offer. Wisdom changes your character which in turn changes your day-to-day activities. Improving your character improves all aspects of your life. You make better decisions the more wisdom you possess. Wisdom is something we should forever seek. Philosophy is the love of wisdom. Anything related to the love of wisdom is philosophy. Anything not related to the love of wisdom is not philosophy. The things universities try to pass as philosophy is absurd. Plato's Academy has been corrupted. It is time for humankind to take back philosophy and share their lives with the public. The amount of knowledge that the Internet can amass is infinite. It is time for us to start filling in the pages of the Internet. If husband and wife did this together with their lives, imagine how much knowledge could be amassed for the benefit of the human species.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Collective Idealogy</p><p>November 24, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>The story of Adam and Eve leads to a conclusion that humans have some sort of inbuilt predisposition to sin. I reject these claims. Humans are born perfect in an imperfect world. Sin is a learned behaviour. Children see other children sinning and then adopt sin into their lives. Adults are role models to children. When they see adults sin they mimic them. It is important for adults to exercise virtue in their actions so their children will mimic that instead of sin. Children are blameless creatures and their actions are learned behaviours. It takes many actions to ingrain behaviours. Children are still exploring and sometimes they might make mistakes. But teaching them wisdom in life will assist them in all of their future endeavours.</p><p><br /></p><p>The story asserts that since Adam and Eve sinned, they passed this sin onto their children, told in the story of Cain and Abel. This sin is then passed on to all future children until the end of time. But have you ever seen a child? Children are innocent and it takes training to entice them into sin. What we inherit is behaviours which can be good or bad. The role models we have in our own life will influence how we act during it. We always have opportunities to change and grow. We are not destined to be like our parents. Our biological identities came from our parents but our emotional identities came from us. We might be predispositioned to follow a particular path but we have options to follow other paths. There is no such thing as original sin. It was a concept created to keep the population in line with the public agenda. Because individually we are sinful creatures. And we need a higher government authority to tell us how to appropriately live life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Christianity hates the body. The body is sinful in their eyes. They accept themselves as sinful creatures and as a result, allow sin into their lives. They have no methods to abolish all sin from their lives. They sin during the week and come together on Sundays to repent for their weekly sins. Church is made for the sinners and not for the righteous. But what structures in society are built for the righteous? Righteous people are not manifesting in society because they have no structural supports to feed and maintain that level of desire. One can read old philosophy to see the human struggle to reach righteousness. Besides this, society has no place for the righteous. Humans are seen as fallible mortals instead of gods. The human potential that could be reached is overlooked in a world of sinners. Celebrities are our role models and we are taken to Hell through their corrupt indoctrination.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Holy Bible is the greatest book of all time. It is like a handbook to live a righteous life. But I don't think it is without error. I don't think that all of the stories pass down positive messages. The beginning of all things is not known to man despite what the Bible says. And the Bible is not written as a factual account but instead stories passed down from generation to generation. I read the Bible every day but at the end of the day it is only a book. The book I appreciate most but a book nonetheless. God did not write the Bible. Individuals inspired by God wrote the Bible. I cannot stand behind these individuals for I know not their motives. But I can appreciate their work that leads my path in life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Religion needs to become more holistic. Churches should arise that worship God and not Jesus. Churches of wisdom would give the righteous a home. Striving for wisdom takes many more sources than just the Bible. How do we jump conclusions in religion so quickly? How can we know that what we are being fed is correct? How can we trust the system when it comes to the fate of our souls? We must stand up individually and create a custom religion that takes into account the life we lived. I will not be judged based on what one religion says. I will be judged based on what I say. There should exist as many religions as there are people on the earth. Everyone has different experiences. And those experiences should shape our own personal religion.</p><p><br /></p><p>It was a shock to me to find no churches that just worship God. Everything is so tightly wound around Jesus being God. Church after church I find worshipping Jesus, using him interchangeably with God. I follow Jesus and his works but that is as far as I can go. He saved me by teaching me another way to walk this earth. I do not believe that he was a virgin birth but does that really make a difference? He was the son of God. He doesn't need God's semen to be the saviour to the many.</p><p><br /></p><p>But I have mixed feelings about Jesus. When we look at his life works one has to stand in awe. But what people made him is idolatry. He was a man born without sin and lived without sin. He is a model example to humanity. But he has become a god that people worship. Due to corrupt powers, his life was used for Satanic purposes. Now, I rarely see someone who follows in the footsteps of Jesus. But I often see people worshipping Jesus. They have placed Jesus on a pedestal because Jesus saves them from their sins. In Jesus, they can live sinful lives and merely repent to him. They have a personal relationship with Jesus and Jesus always forgives them no matter how far they stray.</p><p><br /></p><p>In modern day religion, we have a way to justify our sin. They do not preach about removing sin from your character. But they will preach that Jesus died for their sins. Jesus died because our society killed him. His death showed us how collective decisions can destroy good people. The death of Socrates demonstrates a similar point. If we get caught up in the collective then we will lose our sense of responsibility. And if we are to adopt a collective body of knowledge, we will be judged based off of that. If we are to back the collective form of information then we will be responsible for what that information caused in society. This is why an individual religion is so attractive. Because I will be judged based on what comes out of me instead of being judged based on a collective form of information.</p><p><br /></p><p>The collective acts as an information gateway to extract and develop knowledge. If we are critical then we can build our own beliefs. If we are a puppet then we adopt that collective form of information into our character. Information should be examined critically to see what fits and what does not. This book is a collection of my insights into religion that I built as a result of my life research into religion. It is what fits best with my observations of the world. It is what makes most sense to me. My religion logically asserts the most likely scenario. I believe it because it is what makes most sense to me given the information I have researched. I am shocked to come into this world and find no religions that are similar to my own. How could the people of the past overlook these obvious truths?</p><p><br /></p><p>Where do people like me go to worship God? There is no communal groups that believe anything near what I am talking about. My personal religion has isolated me. I worship God alone in my own way. But I have no friends who would worship God with me. This path does not offer collective reassurance. It is an individual choice that will set you apart from the world. The world has no amenities to cater for the individual who seeks wisdom and not worldly things. You may have to suffer through life to get to the afterlife. No one will hold your hand in this spiritual journey. You may have to fight with loneliness. But what is the afterlife worth to you? Will you endure the pain now so that you can have a happily ever after? Or will you follow the leader and be welcomed into a community that will love and accept you as long as you believe what they believe?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>The New World</p><p>December 2, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>God has a divine plan for those who love Him wholeheartedly. Like previously stated, upon death our souls go on a journey to find other souls similar in nature. This is either Heaven or Hell depending on your character. If you lived a righteous life then your soul will unite with other righteous souls. These souls are then brought back to life through the use of God's technology. The righteous will not be forgotten by God. They will be in charge of forming their own society. Modern day society is very difficult to change because it is led through Satanic influences. The righteous will be given a world to nurture and a society to develop. They will utilise the things that they learned in life to set up society to flourish. Together the righteous will build healthy structures in society that will encourage moral behaviour.</p><p><br /></p><p>I call this idealised land Atheden, coming from Athens and Eden. It is a collection of virtuous souls that have united together. They will create a new world that reflects the nature of God. We will learn more about God's nature and live in unison with God. Jesus will be our king and we will all live very happy lives. There will always be important duties to be carried out so we will never get bored. We will spend our lives serving God. We will create structures in society to both physically and emotionally take care of each other. We will spend the rest of eternity socialising with each other. There will be many unique people to befriend. If we failed at finding our soul mate in this lifetime, there will be many candidates to choose from. We will unite with them and become one person. We will sing in unison with each other and speak as one voice.</p><p><br /></p><p>A chosen people shall arise. Although all souls are immortal, not all souls will be reincarnated. Bringing the dead back to life is a technology that only God possesses. Only God's people will get to experience a new immortal body. All souls seek similar souls to be with. Those who are wicked will be in the company of the wicked. But they will never receive a new body to continue living life. This process is reserved for God's people. Those who are dead to God will remain dead in the company of others like them. This is their Hell and judgement for living a wicked life. Everything we do will come back to us and we will be judged. The sorting mechanism is eternal life with God or eternal death without God. Those who were not righteous do not get the ability to experience life's endgame content.</p><p><br /></p><p>The structure of the world is incredibly complex. Countless systems have been implemented that we had nothing to do with. Imagine the world is a poker arena. The end of the game results in very few individuals with most of the world's resources. These few individuals then create monopolies and then fight for control. They hire workers and pay them the minimum amount possible. This is our economy and it drives our world. The individual in this world has a very limited reach. After twelve books and over one thousand videos, I still have no followers. My voice is muted in society. There is nothing that I can do to change anything. I have been handcuffed in this life. Very few people if any will read this. But this is my place in life. I am a preacher that everybody ignores. The next life will not be like this. My actions in the afterlife will have an effect on the environment around me. This world is restricted by Satanism. The next will be freed by God.</p><p><br /></p><p>We live in the world but are not of it. Our home is Heaven in the presence of God. Our life is a process of going home. This world is just temporary accommodation for our souls until we finally go home. We must be careful about the attachments that we create to the world. All of mainstream is Satanic. This causes most of individual productions to also be Satanic because the individuals have been brainwashed by Satanism. There are very few individuals out there that think for themselves. Most have been indoctrinated by mass media. This creates a particular stream of consciousness. Watch other people. Most cannot sit still. Most always have to be doing something. Most revolve their lives around the screen whether alone or in the company of others. We have lost the ability to just exist together. We always have to be doing something.</p><p><br /></p><p>The human psychology is flawed. But it is not flawed in its original sense. It was perfect but then we invited mainstream into our lives and allowed it to guide and direct them. Slowly we became flawed in the ways that mainstream directs us to be. We think it human nature because it is the way the majority of the population exists. But we overlook the nurture aspect of the equation. Children today are raised on television and games. Those making the television and games are not doing so for the benefit of the consumer. They are destroying the mind and tainting the heart. And for that we dedicate our lives to their entertainment. What is idolatry? I follow specific individuals online. They are my entertainment. I have very little Hollywood in my life. Be careful with what you invest your time into.</p><p><br /></p><p>How are beliefs formed? We are introduced to concepts from the time we are born. Those concepts then broaden our field of thought and we develop beliefs. This can be as simple as trusting that when you step on the floor it will be hard enough to support your weight. We develop ideas about the things we interact with. Then religion steps in and tries to convince you to believe in a collective form of ideology. Believe this and that and you will be saved. Individual ideology is trumped by insecurities about existence. Their existential human crisis persuades them to believe in a collective doctrine because as one person, their own observations cannot be the truth. They must join other people's truth instead of creating their own. And they dismiss this as logical because a collective truth is much bigger than an individual truth. They trust the masses with the fate of their own soul.</p><p><br /></p><p>This phenomenon then produces large groups that believe the same thing independent of logic or common sense. These groups then go on to build an empire around unsound beliefs. This empire then recruits others into their doctrine. This practice then forms an ever growing group of people who believe in nonsense. All religions that I have been exposed to is nonsense. They want us to give up our independent right to judge and replace it with a collective right to judge. Want to know what is right and wrong? Look it up in our texts. Do not use your own autonomy to decide what is right and what is wrong. Because you are a sinful human and any decision you come to on your own is wrong.</p><p><br /></p><p>Beliefs are very powerful. What one believes will guide and direct their lives. It is wise to carefully choose one's beliefs. The beliefs we choose will have an effect on our day-to-day lives. Choosing beliefs in this crazy world is no easy task. One has to first get an idea of the types of beliefs out there. Then they have to thoroughly study them to find what they resonate with. Most people do not get to experience all beliefs. Most people run into belief systems that are linked to their culture. They then adopt those beliefs without understanding other beliefs. Islam is not a part of my culture. Christianity is. Therefore, I was subjected to Christian indoctrination in my childhood. I was taught that we were the chosen people and therefore would be the only people saved by God in the Second Coming.</p><p><br /></p><p>Is this healthy information to teach a child? What are we teaching our children? Because we believe this we are saved and everybody else is damned. This is not the Good News. The Good News is that everybody will get what they deserve because like souls will unite together. The Good News is that we will never be alone again and the character of souls your afterlife seeks will be comparable to the character of your own soul. We should be preaching this because it is invaluable information to know that the character we create will determine where we go in our afterlife. This in itself is motivation enough to strive to live a good life. If society was aware of this information then society would transform as people spent their lives preparing for their afterlife. This is what the Bible means when referring to heavenly treasures. Because we can take nothing with us to the afterlife but our souls.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>The World</p><p>December 4, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>What exactly are worldly things? We must be careful as to how much we involve ourselves in the affairs of this world. This world is not ours and we have little ability to change anything. Our thoughts and feelings will generally end with us. Very few receive a platform to speak. Thus we must utilise this life to prepare for the afterlife where our thoughts and feelings can be propagated throughout society. This existence is a temporary state. It is the beginning of eternity. In life we learn how to die. Each second of existing is pulling us closer to our death. This world continues its cycle of death and rebirth. The material things of the world are only useful to us in life. But what is useful to us in afterlife? What can we bring with us when our heart stops?</p><p><br /></p><p>Ancient Egyptian mythology suggests that Anubis weighs your heart after death. If your heart is as light as a feather, you get to move on to the afterlife. If your heart is heavier than a feather then you would be sent to the Underworld. But how can one's heart weigh less than a feather? This speaks insight into how a person handles situations as they arise. How can one live with a light heart with all of this bad stuff happening around us? My heart was heavy for so long. I very much empathise with the pain felt around the world. But at a certain point, we let go of being held responsible for what is happening in the world. To have a heart as light as a feather means to live in resolve. We could die at any moment and it is our responsibility to appropriately handle anything the world throws at us. If we are emotionally damaged then it is our responsibility to heal.</p><p><br /></p><p>I do not agree with the Egyptian take on entering the afterlife. Those with emotional issues will not be denied entry into Heaven. The question is what you did with all of your time. How did you live your life? Were you a good role model to those around you? Did you encourage others? The actions that we take on a day-to-day basis determine our character. The character of each individual is how we will be judged. Our automatic actions that we have conditioned over our lifetime is what is on trial. How would you consistently respond under a range of scenarios? Getting to Heaven isn't about doing something good here and there. It is having goodness ingrained into you. It is living the goodness found within you.</p><p><br /></p><p>Be careful of friendships. Friends can build you up or tear you down. Realise that most if not all of your friends in this life you may not see in the afterlife. If you get too close to a friend who is worldly, that just might influence you to be worldly. Be careful with how close you get to people. The path to Heaven is a narrow gate. The wide gate leads to Hell. Few will make it to Heaven. Value the people in your life who you know you will see again in the afterlife. For these are eternal friendships. Friendships that revolve around God will flourish for eternity. Don't take it for granted if you have these people in your life. Most will go through life without finding another true believer. Use your life to seek out these people. Because two is better than one. Especially if that friendship transfers into the afterlife.</p><p><br /></p><p>Outside of our vocation we invest our time in entertainment. There are many forms of entertainment. We develop hobbies that throw us into a culture. We join the many before us who pursued that form of entertainment. Therefore we learn from our past. But we must be very careful what mindset we adopt. The world is tainted by Satanism. The practices performed with any topic are ingrained by the foundations of the subject. The methodology utilised to create the foundations haunt current practices. What are the foundations of our entertainment industry? The ideologies pushed through our mainstream entertainment is generally Satanic or at least closely related with Satanism. The doctrines that mainstream entertainment advocate are closely related with the doctrines of Satanism. That is why it is so important to be careful what you invest your time into.</p><p><br /></p><p>Pieces of entertainment have an agenda behind them. There is a reason that they are presenting you that information. Much time and great amounts of labour was extended to bring that information to you. Each scene was carefully thought out and produced to share a message with you. Are these messages of beneficial value to human society? Or were they crafted to destroy it? If media can control how people exist, then they can also control their fates. They are leading a lot of people directly to Hell. The people are willingly destroying their own psychologies. Because in the afterlife they will be spending it with souls like their own. And they will forever torture each other with the psychologies that they made.</p><p><br /></p><p>Be careful what music you listen to. Wholesome music is very rare. Most music shares negative messages but are catchy enough to entice you to sing along. Do not follow this practice. If any of the song promotes something that is against your morals, then the entire song is against your morals. Singing any little of it is promoting the morals of the entire song. I live with little music in my life. I enjoy classical, techno, and game music. I listen to very little music with lyrics. Because there is very little music with lyrics with a good moral. And be careful of Christian music because they might just have you committing idolatry by worshipping Jesus instead of God. It is always the worst when you are singing along to a Christian song worshipping God and then they use Jesus interchangeably with God. That is why Christianity is Satanism. Satan is their Jesus.</p><p><br /></p><p>The answer is to create your own entertainment composed of individuals that you respect and care for. The Internet has enabled us to share our lives with each other. Find individual people who are making content that you resonate with. Choose your role models carefully. Be careful with celebrities because they will only ever show you parts of their lives. I have a good amount of people that I respect that I follow. Their work takes up a good amount of my day. They inspire me in life and guide me to become a better man. They educate me in the areas I find most important in life. What is education? How are we to best educate both ourselves and our children? Do the systems that are officially employed really nurture into well formed adults? What could we do differently to rear competent freethinking young adults?</p><p><br /></p><p>How are children to be entertained? What is it that we are using to entertain children? Why is there a divide between education and entertainment? Why does our entertainment not educate? If society stopped dividing these two subjects then our society would evolve. If we used pieces of entertainment to teach difficult subjects, then our society would be educated without a place of learning. The place of learning is on your phone or on your laptop. It is no longer a school that teaches you subjects. You follow whoever you want and they teach you the things that you find most valuable in life. The Internet is a massive archive of everything that I could ever think of. Eventually you can find people who are into what you are into. It just takes time.</p><p><br /></p><p>The entertainment industry is collapsing. People are replacing television with independent content producers. The old celebrity is the one mainstream media tells us is important. The new celebrity is the individuals who share their lives with their followers. Old celebrities will pass away just as eventually mainstream media will pass away. The new world is the one made by individuals. The old world was the collective that we read about in our false history books. The future is headed towards individualism over collectivism. Everything just takes time. There is only a little good and a whole lot of bad. But that bad eventually becomes good as the plans of God are revealed. God has a plan. God has not left us without hope. We can prevail.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The Rapture</p><p>December 8, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>Eventually, some of the truths that have been stated will prove themselves collectively true. Opportunities will arise for people to ascend emotionally and spiritually. This process will create many divine beings that share their lives with the public. In time, humanity will have many positive role models to follow. This will encourage others to also emotionally and spiritually ascend. The end result is a portion of the society invested in goals of wisdom. This will encourage society as a whole to be more compassionate. People will learn from their role models who teach subjects of virtue. By these individuals sharing their lives, they will improve the health of the entire collective. The new celebrity will be the individual sharing their life instead of the one that mainstream tells us to follow. Individuals will be judged on their character instead of how much money they have in their pocket.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is how I envision the future of the world. All of our problems won't be solved but solutions-driven individuals will be the majority of the influencers. Wicked people will still exist but the world population will be in a mode of healing. Fewer wicked people will manifest under the influence of virtue driven leaders. Suicides will reduce as we learn how to take care of everybody. Society will become more wholesome and a good portion of the population will want world peace. This is the world I see unfolding after the tribulation. This is the thousand years of peace under the rule of Jesus. Because the ideology of Jesus will spread and more and more people will want to become like Jesus. People will strive for compassionate characteristics because they would have realised that ingraining character is the most valuable capability that we have in life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Jesus won't come back on a cloud. Jesus must first come back in your heart. Then be transformed and ascend to the clouds. We must be the Second Coming for it to happen. Waiting around for Jesus to hop on a cloud doesn't conform to what we know as reality. Jesus is dead. Even if the resurrection did occur, the resurrected Jesus only stayed with his disciples for forty days before ascending to heaven. And how was he with them? It took time for them to even notice him. The fact is that Jesus left this world. He is now in Heaven with God, which in time I will join them. How can you have a dead king? The saying goes, "the king is dead, long live the king", meaning long live the new king. As one king dies, another king takes over. How can a king like Jesus be king of our modern times?</p><p><br /></p><p>How can we follow a dead king? Jesus did not live in my lifetime. How can he know of the problems we face in the modern world? I follow the life of Jesus and applied much of his wisdom to my life. But if I am to have a king, I would want one that could understand the plights of the people. Jesus did in his time but the times have changed. And who is to say that a monarchy is the best form of government, even under a benevolent ruler? I have researched many types of governments but never settled on any of them. All governments I have observed do not hold the best interest of the people. I don't know what government will be used in Heaven but I look forward to seeing how it operates. All Earthly applications have failed. It would be good to see the form of government God intended.</p><p><br /></p><p>I look forward to speaking with Jesus in Heaven. But I do not have a personal relationship with Jesus. I understand what Jesus did for me and the rest of the world. I hold appreciation for the actions Jesus took. But I do not pray to him. I pray to God. I have not met Jesus yet so I don't really know what he is like. He sounds like a really great person. If I was to fabricate that Jesus knew me and that I had a personal relationship with him like the Christians do would be absurd. A lot can go on in the mind. Idolatry can be performed in many ways. Jesus has become an idol that Christians emotionally carry with them. They pray to him and worship him. But he never hears their cries. All they are doing is playing a psychological trick on themselves. Creating their own version of Jesus and then having a relationship with it.</p><p><br /></p><p>I can never seem to meet a Christian woman who isn't in love with Jesus. They want to have a three-way marriage. They want to be married to both Christ and their husband. What this ultimately does is drive them further apart because their husband will never match up to her first love, Jesus. Christian women want Jesus in their relationship. Jesus was a real person. Doesn't this seem strange to anyone else? They claim monogamy but then spiritually cheat on their husbands with their own version of white Jesus. I have come to accept that I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. People are too brainwashed to be candidates for what I have in mind. Because I want a good relationship or none at all. If someone is too indoctrinated to see these clear truths that I am presenting, then it could never work. I want eternity with my spouse. I will get that by waiting for the afterlife. I won't get that by settling for someone not appropriate here in life.</p><p><br /></p><p>A problem with religion is that they assert something that is impossible. But the God I have come to know doesn't work with the impossible. The God that I see in the world works with nature and not against it. Nature is a creation of God. God would not create nature only later to defy it. God works within the principles that He implemented. I am not saying that God does not have the power to defy nature. I am merely stating that God wouldn't do that because He invented nature. God will work in the parameters of His own creation. This is not to say that miracles don't exist. This is only to say that miracles will be confined to the reality that He created. God's actions are clockwork and unfold meaning over time. One merely needs to be receptive to miracles unfolding to see the miracles occur in your life and the lives of others.</p><p><br /></p><p>God has always existed. When God decided to create the Universe, He planned for every occurrence. He peered into the future and knew every creation that would result from His actions. He set up every occurrence in every individual's life. He tried to teach His creations through a long process of learning. God does not have to actively take actions upon the world because God already knew every action that would be taken. This does not mean that God does not listen to our troubles. But it does mean that God already knew our troubles before the Universe was created. All required actions to unfold God's plan have already been taken. We must just bide our time and wait patiently for God's plan to be revealed.</p><p><br /></p><p>God uses the bad and in time purifies it to good. An example of this is when butchers experiment with dead bodies. Through this barbaric practice, the human anatomy is discovered and countless fields of practice related to the body are created. We no longer need to dissect human bodies to learn its properties. So the process to discover information is evil, but the fruits it produces can and will eventually be used for good. The evil we see around us will eventually be transmuted into good, furthering the development of God's plan. Do not be afraid of evil because you know what we learn from it will eventually be used for the betterment of the human species. This is why suicide should be legalised. The evil of allowing it will teach us a great deal about depression and suicide. Society would be forced to deal with the problem.</p><p><br /></p><p>What type of society do you want to live in? Gandhi stated that we have to be the change that we want to see in the world. Although currently, wisdom isn't considered an important aspect of society, I have faith that this will change. Providing the world online teachers that are driven towards wisdom will encourage others to direct their lives towards wisdom. The role models of tomorrow will be so because of their character and not status in society. The Internet changes everything if we only learn how to utilise the technology. I can't figure out how to reach the people but maybe you can. In my world, I as one person can't make a difference. But maybe in your world, you as one person can make a difference. Timing is everything. I can't reach many eyes but maybe you can. You will never know until you try.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Emotional Maturity</p><p>December 13, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>Now that my core beliefs have been identified, I start to notice how different my doctrine is to Christianity. It was never my intent to betray my origins, however, the Bible alone could not answer my questions. I do not believe everything in the Bible. There are some verses that I have to be careful with. My only solution was to wipe the slate clean and start over. There are so many religions with ridiculous beliefs. Sometimes it takes an individual heart to battle the collective mind in order to arrive at a religion that makes sense. These are the conclusions that I arrived at over a lifetime invested into wisdom. I could be wrong about many things. But I used my heart and my mind to arrive at these conclusions that I think prove themselves better than any other religion I have experienced.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am very sad that I don't have an audience. Few will ever read these words. My religion manifested from a life of solitude. I never had anyone around me to discuss these subjects with. I constantly try and find individuals to read my work and discuss the subjects with me. But all of my efforts have proven futile. As soon as a book is completed, it is archived never to be read again. All of my efforts preaching has obtained me no friends. This is my twelfth book. I am screaming into an echo chamber. I feel that I am the only one who cares about these subjects. The most feedback that I receive from my work is persecution. Few even call this work. Some even say that I am not writing books but instead, a diary. I have been screaming out about these subjects since my childhood and no one is listening. I feel so alone.</p><p><br /></p><p>This book has been so good for me to just lay out my beliefs. It has given me perspective as well as encouraged me to distance myself from Christianity. Every individual should establish their religion before their death. We will be judged based on what we believe so we must be careful as to what it is that we believe. Satanism takes the form of many different religions. If we mistake evil for good then we will follow evil even if we think it good. I have seen some really bad spiritual energy at churches. The places we go to get closer with God merely gets us closer with Satan. There is no universal people that will obtain exclusive access to Heaven. Each individual will be judged based off of their character and abilities. Heaven is for the individuals and not the collective. Narrow is the passage to Heaven.</p><p><br /></p><p>Within any religion we must ask ourselves the psychosocial ramifications of believing their doctrine. Beliefs form our actions so religious doctrine will determine what we do. As far as I am aware, my doctrine creates freethinking individuals who put their heart into everything that they do. Under the influence of my beliefs, I soar at everything I do. But I must admit that my religion socially isolates the believer. But that is not the ultimate goal. Every day I seek compassionate souls who are interested in the ideas I am forming. I still have hope to find other individuals who will reciprocate with me. I won't give up. I will keep on trying to find hearts and minds that comprehend what I am saying. I still have a long time left to live and that is time that I can use to find like hearts. The ultimate goal in life is to find other believers that you can invest in that will reap rewards both in this life and the next. It is not the intention of this doctrine to create socially isolated individuals.</p><p><br /></p><p>But how hard it is to find good people. I have friends in this life. But they are not friends that care about these subjects. I distance myself from my friends because they are not believers. I will only see them in this lifetime. But we should be gathering up treasures in Heaven while we live here on Earth. Heavenly treasures are heavenly people. People we want in our lives are people we will see in both this life and the next. Our true friends are the people we will see for eternity. There is no app to find people like this. You may never find them. But I will spend my life trying because I really want eternal relationships. It is so hard to know where to go. Where do I find virtuous people? I know they are out there somewhere so I will just keep trying and maybe one day God will smile upon me and link me up with a new best friend.</p><p><br /></p><p>Spending your life searching for wisdom emotionally develops your soul. Empathy towards all creatures is emotional enlightenment. You can't just talk the talk. You have to walk the walk. Being human is all about choices. I don't agree with homosexuality but people have choices. If they want to do something that doesn't hurt anybody else then who am I to prohibit it? Every day we choose and that is what is so wonderful about life. People need the ability to choose what life they are going to lead. These choices may be self-destructive but a person has that right. Every day I am presented countless choices. And every one of us needs the ability to make these choices without subjugation, persecution, or oppression.</p><p><br /></p><p>Life is about growing. I will find people to read my work. Just because I don't have an audience is irrelevant. I have the product. My only goal in all of this is to find people to talk about these subjects. As long as I find people, no matter how few, to occasionally read and discuss my work then I consider myself successful. My work is not made for the collective. It is made for the individual. And there is enough work there to keep a person occupied indefinitely. It just depends on how interested the person is in the subjects. People can experience as much or as little as they want of mine, all for free. The resources are available. It just takes time and dedication to learn my true story. The backstory is there if anyone is interested.</p><p><br /></p><p>My past work is embarrassing. I spent twelve years filming to a fictional girl who I wanted to become reality. That failed and now I am too old to achieve what I set out to achieve. To a certain extent, I want my old work to stay in the past. The work always had bad endings. I was searching for a girl who would write and make films with me. I failed at finding a wife so now I wait until the afterlife to find her. Now I search for friends who are interested in what I have to say. I have failed at my main mission in life so now I try and complete the side quests. Be careful about experiencing my past work. You might not like the answers I provided. Even though it was all embarrassing, I still stand by the work. And if I was only younger then I could have obtained the love that I so sought.</p><p><br /></p><p>But this book is about new beginnings. My old work is archived and my new work will lay my foundations. Tomorrow is another day. Another day to search for compassionate souls to discuss these subjects with. Another day to try and morally get through life. What will happen next is unknown. All I have to do is create the possibilities and wait for the catch. I am a fisher of men. What I will catch with my words, if anything, is unknown. Tomorrow could bring in the people I seek. Hope is a very powerful tool. Prayer is a very powerful tool. If we as a society grew spiritually then we could collectively gain enough insight by having empathy for our fellow human beings. If we only shifted our role models to virtue focused people, then we could collectively gain enough common sense to follow people who are trying to save the world. If our sources of inspiration were spiritually developed individuals then we would inspire the common person to save the world. And with all of our world-saving efforts, we would all together save the world.</p><p><br /></p><p>We need the ability to cry. If crying is restricted then we will never be capable of emotionally handling our problems. Crying is a purifying experience. Both males and females need the ability to cry if they need to. And we as a society need to stand up and be a positive support for each other. Too often have people told me to kill myself in this life. This is not a healthy aspect of society. We need to collectively emotionally develop as a society and support people who are sad and reaching out. Suicides occur as a result of a long time of suffering. In most instances the victim has spent much effort attempting to get help. Loneliness is a big problem in society. It takes you to stand up and be supportive to those in need to solve it. You are society's only chance at enlightenment. How will you exist? What is your moral obligation?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Moral Obligations</p><p>December 18, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>What are our moral obligations as individuals? What are our collective responsibilities? What does an individual need to be healthy? It is society's responsibility to maximise the reduction of suffering. Everybody needs food and clean water. Somewhere to sleep and store their possessions. So it is society's responsibility to provide these basic necessities to the people. But is society only responsible for the physical? Humans need emotional support to live successful lives. Therefore it should be society's responsibility to also provide emotional support to the community. But why stop there? Society would also provide for those who are spiritually searching. But these are collective actions that need to be taken. What can you do as an individual to change the world? What actions can you take in life that will ascend your character?</p><p><br /></p><p>Assess your life and see what areas you can be useful to society in. If you can, feed the poor. Use your gifts to improve the society around you. Document your life so that you can see your progression. Be useful to society.  Do what you can to be a positive influence. Be a good role model for those around you. Don't allow life to walk all over you. Take your life by the reins and lead it wherever you want to be. Don't give up. Keep trying new things. Don't allow people to belittle you. Stand up for yourself. Guide your life into whatever speciality fields that you are most adapt at. Take actions slowly. Don't rush. Don't be hasty. Allow life to unfold one section at a time. Be the best you that you can be. Shine as who you are and don't be embarrassed. The answer is so close.</p><p><br /></p><p>Each individual is incredibly unique and there is no one size fits all. You will have to create your own world one step at a time. Don't expect your world to just appear. You have to make it yourself. Your responsibilities will depend on who you are as a person. How you handle life will be unique to you. Assess your personal responsibilities and ensure you achieve them. We only get one life to learn what we need to do in it. We need to carefully reflect on our obligations in this life. Life is a precious gift and everybody has obligations. Not everyone knows or fulfills their obligations. This is why we need to spend the time to assess what we are required to do in this lifetime. Nobody can tell you what your responsibilities are. This is something that we find out over time.</p><p><br /></p><p>The world is not welcoming. No matter what group I join, I receive haters that insult me. No one but myself ever stands up for me. Don't we want to create an inviting world? A world where people can speak freely without the risk of persecution. Who's responsibility is it to make this world? There are no groups on the Internet that this type of material is warmly received. Why do we have people that insult others for no reason? I want to live in a loving world but all I can find here is hate. Why do I search for love but almost exclusively find hate? Where are all the lovers? We must take responsibility for the groups we create and manage. If they are not welcoming then there is a big problem that must be rectified. Where is the person who is fed up with life go to get assistance? The answer is not a doctor. The public community needs to learn how to be compassionate to each individual they come across. You never know what horrors lie beneath the surface of a person's life.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the afterlife you are held accountable for what you do in life. You will be judged based off the actions you took in life. An angel and a devil are on everybody's shoulders. The choices you make in life will determine where your soul ends up. We must try to make the best choices possible because we will live their results. Many aspects of life are seemingly unaccountable but our choices will come back to haunt us. We must spend our lives trying our best to be good people. We must contemplate how our actions effect others around us. And we must make adjustments to our actions to improve the lives of not only ourselves but also everybody around us. Through this process we refine our individual character.</p><p><br /></p><p>It is our responsibility to fix the flaws we find within our character. We must carefully reflect on our own decisions and the effect they have on others. We must then implement practices that will resolve our character flaws. Those who do not do this in life will enter the afterlife with those character flaws. The objective is to become heavenly so we can live in Heaven. Those who are not heavenly characters will not be capable of entering Heaven. Thus, we must fix our problems in life or we will reap those repercussions. Life is for going beyond itself. Beyond our humanly problems. We must reach high because we know that we will suffer the consequences. Life is a playground for us to learn. We must utilise our time wisely and take opportunities to grow.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will give you a little insight into my writing. I oftentimes share my writing with Facebook groups. Currently I am in religious debate groups. Whenever I share my work to a public audience, I am attacked on all fronts. Instead of having a discussion about the subjects, I am personally attacked. I sometimes find a few genuine people, but that is very rare. The majority of the population treat me terribly merely for trying to communicate these subjects. That isn't the world I want to live in. Everybody is too afraid to open up to others because they will be attacked if they do so. This creates a society that is emotionally closed. This mentality becomes dominant and people think that everybody in society is like this when in fact, it is just the few.</p><p><br /></p><p>But the impact this practice has on society is phenomenal. People close themselves off. People don't want to get into discussions with other people about sensitive information because they are afraid of being personally attacked. This discourages society to grow and we never get to the bottom of information because we never share with the public. This causes the biased media to control topics and what information is allowed in the discussion of the topics. Very few people in this world have a mouthpiece to speak. There is nothing an individual can say that will collectively change the way the world functions. No one cares about what anybody has to say. People don't allow other people to speak freely. This needs to change for society to grow into a utopia.</p><p><br /></p><p>I spend a lot of time on Facebook telling people to leave me alone. Just because I posted a chapter of my book does not mean that people can attack me. But I wish it ended with their attacks. Because their next move is to harass. People won't stop insulting me in different ways. I oftentimes am required to block evil people who have attached themselves to me. It has come to the point where I try and avoid everybody who is not compassionate. This means that I try and avoid most of the people. I am searching not for the many but instead the few. I put my heart out there and await compassionate souls to hear my words. There are very few of these people but I won't stop trying. I am trying to find my people here in life. I won't allow a bunch of idiots to stop me from doing that.</p><p><br /></p><p>This concludes with having a sense of belonging. I have never had a sense of belonging. I have found no groups in life that accept me unconditionally. I am trying to find my place in life and that means searching for people receptive to this sort of content. The haters stand between me and my family. I want to find friends in this life that are like family. I want to find others that care about these subjects. Why is it so hard to find people that care about these subjects? These subjects are central to our human condition. Why do the words of philosophers cause so much strain in society? Why do people reject this information even though it is based around their own inner being? How can people read these words and immediately attack the writer of them? Life isn't fair. Why is life not fair? What can we do to make life more fair for all who play it?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>The Cross</p><p>December 21, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>The cross is transformational. It represents accepting your destiny. There was a reason that the front cover of this book is a cross. Because living a life like this sets you apart from others. If we are to die on our cross, we are to be reborn again anew. Our old life filled with the obsession of the material is behind us. And a new life begins obsessed with the spiritual. The story of Jesus taught us many things. He accepted his destiny in spite it leading to his death. He stood up for what he believed in to the point that the people killed him. His example demonstrates how we should live without fear, despite being surrounded by a bunch of vultures. His life demonstrated how people attack virtuous individuals. In our current world, this is unavoidable.</p><p><br /></p><p>But I don't want to live in that type of world. As Gandhi stated, we must be the change that we wish to see in the world. The ultimate goal of humanity is to stop persecuting righteous people. We get very few righteous people in this world because the righteous are attacked. Those who make wise decisions are treated terribly which discourages them from committing righteous actions. The easiest solution is to become like everybody else. But that is not the cross. The cross is standing firm in your decisions. I know for a fact that righteous people are healthy for the human population. Therefore, one should remain righteous despite the fact that they are constantly attacked for their actions. We must be brave like Jesus and stand strong, even if it leads to our death.</p><p><br /></p><p>Society is stagnant because it has removed moral consideration from the actions of our day-to-day lives. Everything is permissible as long as you don't kill or steal. The value of our words have been diminished and everything becomes permissible to say. Most live out lives of selfishness. Few are compassionate in today's society. Fighting with each other is what we do. We have lost the ability to calmly speak to each other about subjects. People make personal attacks and ignore the messages. People read a few sentences and think they instantly know what you are saying. People have lost the ability to ask pertinent questions. People assume that those who sound sophisticated are idiots. Language has been corrupted as definitions like "man" and "woman" change. Whoever controls the dictionary controls the ways in which people think.</p><p><br /></p><p>Jesus didn't die for our sins. Jesus died from our sins. Until the people can see this fact, sages will always be persecuted. Jesus died because society killed him. The sickness in society made it possible to execute a man without sin. This should be a lesson to the people to not persecute spiritual people. But Christians are one of the worst at persecuting spiritual people. How can they only value the teachings of one sage? How can they crucify others who think differently to them without relating that with the story of their saviour? Even though I no longer call myself Christian, I am still a follower of Jesus. But where is the distinction? Following a deceased mortal man or worshipping Jesus as God? What type of disciples did Jesus want? Did he want people to bow down to him?</p><p><br /></p><p>The difference is learning from a teacher or bowing down to a god. Jesus has not only been made into a god but into God. Jesus has been made into the alpha and omega. Jesus has taken God's place on the throne. However, when one only looks at Jesus as a wise teacher, the entire Christian doctrine breaks down. Maybe Jesus was the son of God but that doesn't make him God. I am not my father. Jesus even says that he comes in the name of his Father and not his own name. And there are verses against celebrating Christmas, yet the Christians still do it. They worship Jesus and don't even believe in their own Bible. Most people use religion to justify their own sins. Many verses the religion will never touch. Christianity is full of hypocrites.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tattooed to my back is a big cross. To me it means accepting my destiny and allowing the persecution and subjugation it results. You can't preach in this world without experiencing it. Everyone that has opened their heart up to the public knows this. Most people will run away from who they are and hide themselves. Few will put their neck on the line despite knowing that persecution will result. We need these types of people in society in order for it to grow. People that speak their heart publicly are extremely rare. These are the people that change the world. We cannot save the world using the same failed practices that have so far been trying to save the world. We need innovation and a way to connect hearts. Those who take actions even when the absurd will result are followers of the cross.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have no way to share the messages in this book. I will provide free copies for those around me who will read it. I will continue to search for people interested on Facebook. I will turn this into an audiobook and share it on video websites. But I have been doing this for many years and still end up with no friends to discuss these subjects with. I don't know what else I can do. I have spent a lot of money on advertising. You can help me a lot by sharing this with loved ones. All of this is the conclusions of a lifetime of searching. I don't know any knowledge more valuable. It would mean a lot to me if you could do what is in your power to help me find more friends. Why not become a friend of mine yourself? What do you have to lose? What do you have to gain?</p><p><br /></p><p>Jesus called upon God and not unto himself. He was a servant to God and not unto himself. His path in life taught us many lessons. And his end was public execution. He was a martyr. So the Christians eat his flesh and drink his blood. The bond that they receive from this ritual grants them eternal life. Through the flesh and blood of Christ, they are transformed into a new person. Their revival from the dead grants them special powers to communicate with the dead. Praise Jesus, for we can now be in a personal relationship with him! The fictions we create in our head will determine the ways in which we act. A person would have to be pretty brainwashed to believe this doctrine. It defies the reality in which we live.</p><p><br /></p><p>If more people carried unique beliefs and were willing to die for them, then our world would evolve. To believe in something means that you think it true despite not having the evidence to back it up. I have shared many of my beliefs. There are many conclusions that I arrived at that have missing links when it comes to evidence. What is a soul anyways? And how would I have the insight to know where they go upon our death? Can the mind really be transferred? I have faith that what I am saying is accurate to the best of my ability. Even if I am wrong about particular areas, the doctrine is still valid because of its transformational effect on those who believe it. You will become a better human living by a doctrine similar to mine. Its effects justify the belief whether or not it is right or wrong.</p><p><br /></p><p>How can you live the best life possible for yourself? Before you are many choices and your answers will determine the outcome of your character. What you believe will determine your future possibilities. The ways in which you invest yourself into the spiritual will determine the day-to-day actions you take in life. Will you allow this to inspire you to dig a little deeper? Beliefs act as coping mechanisms for the things we don't understand in life. Where we stand will determine how we approach life. What we do in life will be rooted to our beliefs. How we pass our time will be determined by what we worship. This is a doctrine of liberation. Because by using our hearts and minds, we come closer to the truth. And this is the closest to the truth that I could get in life.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Acceptance</p><p>December 28, 2022</p><p><br /></p><p>In time, the terrible things the government have done to the human population will be revealed. The government will no longer be a trusted form of authority. The population will rebel and new forms of government will be erected. Eventually, democracy will be proven as the fraud it is. Law will be restructured and the government minimised. The world will become more efficient and environmentally wise. New technologies will arrive that encourage people to invest themselves digitally. The ways in which we use spaces will evolve digitally. Gaming will dominate the world. Education through games will continue to grow. Digital identifications will replace our physical medium. New materials will be discovered and power will become a renewable resource.</p><p><br /></p><p>I feel like my time with these subjects is coming to an end. I have been screaming out about these subjects for a long time. And I have acquired no people to discuss these subjects with. I am starting to age and I am exhausted. I feel that my mission has failed because I couldn't find anyone interested in these subjects. And there is nothing more that I can do. I have already spent a lot of money on advertising. Nothing I do reaches people. I think it is time that I give up and just accept what is. I have spent so long searching for like hearts and like minds. I failed to even find one person. So it is time to assess what I do have in life and work with that. I have friends and family. Although I have none who share my beliefs, my beliefs place me with others who have similar beliefs in the afterlife. It is time to stop chasing what isn't there.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am a unique creation. There are not many like me. Thus it is reasonable to say that it would be very difficult to find others like me. Therefore I should not expect to find friends similar to me. My life was made as a solo journey. I am playing a one player game. It is time to look at my writing as a personal diary instead of distributed work. What is it that I could say that hasn't already been said? What could I really know about the nature of God and the Universe? I am just a mortal man. I am a schizophrenic. What grasp could I have on the nature of reality when I am deemed to not comprehend reality? I am just an eccentric that documents my version of reality. How could my version be any better than anyone else's? What could I possibly know that is valuable?</p><p><br /></p><p>My video adventures ended this year. I stopped making videos about philosophy. I think this will be the last book that I write, at least for a while. I wanted to get out a summary of everything I learned from my adventures. I wanted a book to trump them all. Conventional wisdom tells you to seek and you will find. Life lessons taught me the opposite. I spent many years trying to find a wife and I failed. I also spent my whole life trying to find friends who want to talk about these subjects. That failed too. It is time for me to stop searching and just appreciate what I do have in life. I might not have anyone to talk about morality but I do have people who ask how I have been. My hopes and dreams in this world have failed. So I now just have to live the rest of my life as comfortable as possible.</p><p><br /></p><p>Acceptance is a powerful tool. It can be difficult to accept some truths. It takes time to accept difficult truths. It takes wisdom to know when to give up. I give up. Nothing that I do changes anything anyways. I need to stop searching for fictional people. If they existed, they would be my friend. I don't think my people exist, at least not yet. And I am not capable of creating them. So it comes to the time where I am to give up on all of my hopes and dreams and just accept what the world has given me. I failed at reaching hearts. I failed at reaching minds. But I was successful in creating my own character. I can't influence the world but I can influence myself. My reach was always internal and not external. I was looking at things backwards. I do all of this to develop my character. Not to reach people.</p><p><br /></p><p>I need a change in my life. I have to start doing something different. Making videos and writing obviously did not find me my people. I need to put my failures behind me and be content with what is. My future will belong personally to me. I was a public domain person in my past and now it is time for me to develop back into a personal person. I have a life that I no longer wish to share with others. Sharing my life with others hurt me and obtained me stalkers who wished harm against my person. I tried and failed at living a public life. The time is now for me to develop my personal life. I did not find my people so I will learn to be happy with the friends and family that I do have. I have already said goodbye to my video work so now it is time for me to say goodbye to my text work.</p><p><br /></p><p>I really tried hard in this life. I spent my life sharing the things that I found most important in life. I was wholeheartedly dedicated to the cause. Things didn't turn out how I wanted but I spent a great deal of effort trying to make things happen. And now I look back on it all and see failure. But what did I expect, to be able to control the environment around me? I was only ever in control of me. I can't control the actions of other people. My responsibility in life was my actions. I, as one person, cannot effect the environment around me. God has only given me this character to craft. I cannot craft the characters of those around me. God has given me an inside temple to decorate. I can't control the outside world. My home is clean because I care about living in a comfortable environment. The world is not clean because collectively, we don't care about living in a comfortable environment.</p><p><br /></p><p>Can I live a life without writing? I would have to find other ways to organise my thoughts. Writing is a passion of mine so it will be difficult to completely remove it from my life. But making videos used to be a passion of mine but I don't do that anymore. Revealing your soul leaves you open to the attacks of others. It is not a good idea to open myself up to the public. The public have shown me time and time again how hurtful they can be. I need to stop doing this to myself. Once upon a time I was an open person. But after this book I will try and become a closed person. I am tired of being abused for sharing what I find most important in life. There is no audience for this type of content. Continuing to release more would be self-destructive. It is time to make something new with my life.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have done a lot of soul searching in my life. I still have a lot more soul searching to do. I need to learn ways to express myself without making myself vulnerable to outside attacks. I have written a lot over my lifetime. I don't need to write anymore. There is nothing more that I can say that would further contribute to my message. I have already said what needed to be said. I don't have to keep saying the same message in different ways. The message is out there. Maybe no one knows about it but it is out there. I will not die wishing I said something. Everything important I have already said. I am content with my work and its conclusions. I have made peace with everything that happened. It is time for me to turn to more positive things. It is time for me to build a life for myself outside of videos and writing.</p><p><br /></p><p>The journey made who I am today. It is time for me to take what I learned and apply to private life. No longer shall I shed tears on the Internet. I will find a new life outside of being an author. I will find value and meaning in the menial day-to-day tasks of life. I no longer have to share my insights. The obsession of writing hasn't helped me in life. Sure, it enables me to assess my thoughts. But that can be accomplished through different outlets. Being so open with the Internet has in fact hurt me. What I was trying to accomplish failed. It is time that I move on with my life in a private way. The public figure failed so I am trying to pick up what pieces remain and build a life that I find meaningful. Because I am obviously failing at discussing these subjects with the public.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Reconditioning</p><p>January 2, 2023</p><p><br /></p><p>This book has brought me to a turning point in my life. I have decided to no longer live a public life. But what would a private life look like under these moral conditions? I must learn to put my religion into practice in a private world. What are my moral obligations if it is to no longer preach my heart? I have been there and done that and it didn't work. So how am I to integrate my own personal religion into the day-to-day activities of private life? My obligation to preach has already been accomplished. No one listened. It is time to move on with the understanding that my personal religion will only ever be that, a personal religion. The information is there for anyone lucky enough to stumble upon it. I don't need to keep repeating myself. It is time for me to invest in things that benefit my life positively instead of investing all of my emotions into things that hurt me.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will not push my religion on anyone. I will openly share it with anyone who asks. The collective will eventually learn right action as a result of a whole lot of wrong action. They don't need me scolding them about how they are making the wrong decisions. My beliefs are personal and not collective. I shouldn't expect the collective to believe what I believe. There are no more reasons to preach. The people have already rejected what I offered. I am not going to force anything down their throats. If they want food for the soul then they know where to go. If not, who am I to push this on them? This does not mean that I will never preach. It just means that I will wait for the right time to preach. Or maybe I should not preach anymore but instead nudge people to the right choices.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will value my friendships more. It doesn't matter if they are not believers. They still choose to hang around me. My friends are incredibly valuable because I would be very lonely without them. I just have to get through life. It doesn't matter that I haven't found people to talk about the subjects that I really care about. I have been trying and failing at talking about those subjects my entire life. I obsessed about these subjects. But why do I need to obsess about them anymore? I have already found resolution. I have already found the answers that I sought. I no longer seek the answers for the questions I have answered. The process is complete. I accomplished my mission. One no longer seeks for what they have already found.</p><p><br /></p><p>What type of person do I want to become? How do I wish to alter my personality for my private future? For the most part, I am exactly the person that I want to be. There are only a few sections of my life that irritate me. I get bored often. I need more things to do in my life. Originally, I wanted online friends to talk about important subjects with. But that failed so I now need to explore my options. How am I going to utilise my time if I am not writing or making videos? I need to find a satisfying substitution. Writing and making videos hurt me and I need to stop self-destructive behaviour. Talking to myself could be a beneficial outlet to process my feelings. I should also pick up some hobbies. Obtaining a job would help reduce my boredom. It is time to focus on things that improve the quality of my life.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have lost interest in video games. I have also lost interest in the television. Lately, I have spent a lot of time just sitting and contemplating. I have a lot to think about because I tried a lot of things in this life. I am never short of an issue to contemplate. This life is incredibly complex and it takes careful thought to organise. Digesting the ways in which I feel about things that happen takes a lot of time. Having no outlet to write would require me to organise myself differently than previously. Currently, my writing teaches me what to do next with my life. I will have to devise strategies to structure my life outside of writing. No longer will writing be able to teach me what to do next. I must rely on other approaches to organise and develop my thoughts.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing is like a retreat for my mind. It focuses me and enables me to articulate my thoughts and feelings. When I am writing, nothing else matters except the topic I am focused on. Maybe I will focus my writing in letters to penpals instead of to the public. I don't have to entirely give up writing. I just need to turn the public activity into a private activity. Currently, I write public letters to the world. Maybe turning that into one recipient would satisfy my desire to write while actually reaching someone. This is a great idea because I would be able to still express myself while also staying out of the public eye. I am going to start writing letters to penpals. This is a way to positively use my gifts in society without opening myself up to the public.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am exactly the person that I want to be for my future. All of my negative experiences on the Internet taught me many lessons. Society isn't ready for people to publicly open themselves up. They are too harsh and hostile. From here on out it is me and my religion against the world. The previous public life was learned from and a private life is about to manifest. The public life was the seed for the new private life. I will remember the lessons I learned and will apply them to private life. All I have to do is stop writing public letters. This book concludes my life of public letters. I have already stopped making videos. It is time to archive everything and then live the life that I have built for myself. I have collected many treasures that transfer into private life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Today I deleted the Holy Bible from my phone. It gave me daily Bible verses to contemplate. I have questioned many of the verses in the Bible. And my religion is no longer Christianity. I no longer need wisdom from the Bible to guide and direct my life. I have my own Bible and it guides and directs my life. It was written personally for me to digest what it is that I believe in this world. And since Christianity is no longer what I believe, I no longer need doctrine from that religion. Most verses in the Bible are inspirational but few are questionable. I don't want to be tainted by the questionable material. My material encourages virtue more so it has to be closer to the truth than the things the Bible want us to accept as true merely because it states it.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will enjoy life as it unravels. I will enjoy learning new things and just chill during the slow times. The world I live within is my own creation. I am in charge of its further development. I will not worry about the things that I cannot control. I will further explore my relationships with friends. I will make new friends. I will be content with what is. I won't worry about finding a romantic relationship. I will explore letter writing. I will try to get a job. The only hurdle that I may struggle with is the feeling of having something inside that you want to get out and share. A private life is different from a public one. The public life, all new feelings are documented online. In the private life I will have to learn different outlets to satisfy the need to share. This will be my primary struggle in the transition from public life to private life.</p><p><br /></p><p>All together, I am happy with who I am as a person. I still have many areas of life to develop. I have made many mistakes over my life. But I generally do not make mistakes anymore. I have come so far with so little. I have developed into a virtue driven man. A private life won't change my desire for virtue. I will still be who I am. I am not going to change. All that will alter is some practices that I have picked up that ultimately harmed me. But I can turn that negativity into positivity by adjusting my actions to promote the development of private life. It is dangerous to live on the Internet. I lived on the Internet when I was homeless. But I am no longer homeless so I can now safely unpack my things. I no longer have to post my emotional well-being on the Internet.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Passing Time</p><p>January 9, 2023</p><p><br /></p><p>The most important question that humans face is how to pass their time. There is this life unfolding in front of us and we are asked what to do about it. We face this question on every conscious existence. What are you going to do with the given? Life is precious so how will we pass it? More importantly, how are we to ethically pass our time? All of this stuff happens and we are asked what of it. This echoing reminder that I exist is the human condition that I have gotten to know. Where we came from and the nature of the Universe are not ultimately the questions that we battle. We battle day-to-day existence. How we spend our time will shape us. What is the nature of consciousness? Will the investments in time that I give to the world shape me into the person I want to be?</p><p><br /></p><p>This pressure of living burdens us. Some become suicidal because of it. It taunts you by forcing time to pass. We are given little guidance in adulthood on how to pass time. We want to be serene and peaceful but our inner demon mocks us by making time spent alone feel unnatural. We are overcome with a feeling of needing to do something to pass that time. But that merely distracts us from our inner problems. People pass time in many ways but are these distractions from life in solitude healthy for our human psychology? Being alone with oneself can be a frightening thought. Not knowing how to best occupy your time is even scarier. But which of these pass times condition my psychology positively and which damage my mental health? Knowing what to spend your time on is the hardest question known to man.</p><p><br /></p><p>How we spend our time in the present effects what happens in the future. Our time is incredibly valuable because it shapes our human psychology. If we spend time with meaningful investments then those investments will reap rewards. If we damage our psychology with useless media, then those messages we invest in will shape our character. If we do nothing meaningful then we will not grow as individuals. If we never take risks then we will not have the opportunity to develop as a person. Being a public person for so long was a huge risk to me and it didn't manifest any rewards except the knowledge that I tried my hardest to reach the people. The process also built and rebuilt my character publicly. There are positives in doing this work. The negatives just outweigh the positives.</p><p><br /></p><p>I do not want to discourage anyone from becoming a public person. In fact, I encourage it. It will mature you quickly. Just be ready for the criticism that will come your way. Opening up your heart to the world will result in many people attacking your heart. But this will make your heart strong and conditioned. Unfolding your psychology on camera changes you as a person. You see yourself from the outside. It is the best character building solution known to man. You literally make your own character on camera. And then you watch the character that you created play out. You become the hero or heroine of your own television show. This creates a sense of meaning in someone's life. I was most depressed in this life when I was homeless but I kept going back to the camera to update a fictional audience about my well-being. The camera was my friend when I had none.</p><p><br /></p><p>I used to pass time by making videos or writing books. That will now change as I retreat from the public eye. I must find relevant substitutions to pass future time. Making videos and writing really developed me as a person. But it is time to move on to better things. I have already said everything that I could have wanted to say. I revealed everything to you. There is nothing important left in my story. The journey is complete and it is time to move on. There is no point wallowing in the past. The future is to share my life with penpals and friends. At least that way I have an audience. And I don't have to open myself up to the hurtful comments of the public. But there is a difference between passing time and ethically passing time. I want to ethically pass my time.</p><p><br /></p><p>What is the difference between passing time and ethically passing time? They are two modes of existence. Just passing time cares nothing for the ethical implications of their actions. Whereas passing time ethically deeply considers what the effects of their actions are. How am I to ethically exist? To look for opportunities to be useful is an ethical way to exist. There is a lot of bad around us and it is our job to decide what we fight for. We can choose to fight publicly or privately. Both methods incur their difficulties. How to live a virtuous life privately is different than the public answer. The private life is more difficult to live virtuously because the public does not know your moral compass. Being open with the world about your intentions justifies actions taken to reach your intentions. The public life is the best choice to test your moral ambition.</p><p><br /></p><p>What type of media should I invest my time in and what should I stay away from? There exists many ways to waste time. I have decided that Hollywood should not play a significant role in my life. I also try and stay away from music with lyrics because rarely do the lyrics reflect my own view. I have invested my time in individual content creators who utilise independent thought. It is so much better to follow certain people you respect than to invest your life into mainstream media. Individuals who disseminate mainstream information in critically thought out packages are worth following. An individual can always keep up with the collective but the collective can never keep up with the individual. Media created by a single individual or a small group of people in many ways trumps mainstream media.</p><p><br /></p><p>And what is with our video game library? Violence is something that happens rarely in life yet most of our games thrive off violence. Where are the games that simulate life adventures? Can they really not give me a non-violent solution? Why are all of our role-playing games combat based? Can't I have a nice adventure without anyone dying? Games really speak miles about our culture. They are people's fantasies realised. Why are all of our collective fantasies so violent? Have we lost the ability to tell wholesome stories? Why do wholesome stories not sell? Drugs, sex, and violence sells. So our products centre around these concepts. A platform that could have been used to instil good morals has been desecrated. Digital games could have solved so many of our human problems. The industry is currently being underutilised. It has so much potential to encourage human development.</p><p><br /></p><p>It is difficult to talk about consciousness. It is always there in front of us. It is how we utilise what is presented to us. It is the facilities that we are equipped with to go through life. It is always in our presence or maybe it is our presence. It is the electricity flowing through your brain. I have heard it called the froth of the beer or the wash of the ocean. It is how we process the world around us. Sleep pauses its functionality only to resume after sleep has been obtained. Dreams also give us an experience of consciousness, although it is much more lucid. Are dreams closer to how a soul will feel after death? Sleep is the death of the day. And waking up is being born into the world again. Living is all we are required to do. How we live determines the provisions we will acquire in life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Conscious activity builds the life that we are subjugated to. We must be very careful in how we employ consciousness because we will live its results. There exist many different modes of consciousness depending on the activity. The trick is being aware of your consciousness and this enables you to make slight modifications with it. We craft the world that appears before us. The tools we have to work with are the ones we have discovered. This subject is so rarely talked about in society. We take for granted the given. Thus many never realise the tools that are available to them to train and condition their conscious activity. The result is a world full of immature people who don't know how to develop their conscious activity. What a world this would be if the general public utilised their consciousness for character development.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Justification for Work</p><p>January 11, 2023</p><p><br /></p><p>This chapter will be exclusively for those who are familiar with my past work. Little of it will be comprehensible without knowing my past work. I will speak of topics that cannot be understood without being aware of the secrets behind my work. I did a lot of things and some of them are morally questionable. I took these actions for a reason. I followed the stories of wisdom in attempts to achieve a positive outcome. I failed but I am glad I tried. It showed me the truth about society. They reacted by incarcerating me indefinitely. Society isn't ready for the topics I unfold in my work. They are not yet mature enough to engage in such subjects. A new day may arise where society is able to maturely discuss these subjects. But until that day, I will always be cast out of the system.</p><p><br /></p><p>The wife of Orpheus dies and he is overcome with grief. He travels to the Underworld to reach his queen and then attempts to take her back with him to the world of the living. His only stipulation was to not look back at his wife until he reaches the upper world. He fails and looks back on her thus ending the tragedy. But I learn from the lessons of mythology. I didn't look back. But when I arrived in the upper world, Eurydice was gone. Maybe my story more resembles Lot's wife looking back at Sodom and turning to a pillar of salt. But either way you look at it, I did not back down. The pieces I assembled merely deteriorated in my hands. My actions were morally right and even virtuous. I am not ashamed of what I did. I am, however, embarrassed about what I did.</p><p><br /></p><p>I will again become a public person if I ever find a wife to do it with me. It is just so hard to do this alone. I want to collaborate thoughts through writing and videos. That is my ultimate goal. But it is one I don't see myself ever being able to achieve. Finding a wife that communicates her soul through writing and videos is a fairy tale. I followed the story of Pygmalion in attempts to find me my Ivory. That failed. All of these stories that attempt to communicate virtue fail when applied to real life. What are the chances that I can find someone that fits in with my religion? I am thirty-eight years old. My prime is behind me. All of the good girls have been taken. To find someone to join me in my life seems out of reach. No one would ever be good enough.</p><p><br /></p><p>I never hurt anyone in my adventures. I only communicated a message that made people uncomfortable. I stand by that message, although I am now too old to achieve what I set out to do. The message is still very relevant to society and one day society will have to deal with those topics. But, because of my age, I have to pull out of that race. But that doesn't detract from the messages explored in my work. The work is still valid and I made it all to be timeless so it doesn't matter if I remain undiscovered for many years. My work can get buried but it is ingrained into the Internet. One day the events that unfolded will be revealed. Or maybe they won't but who cares? All that matters is that I tried to do the right thing. My motives were always pure.</p><p><br /></p><p>If I knew then what I know now things would have been different. I would not have tried it. But the experience really matured me as a person. I don't have an audience so what did it really accomplish? It did not get me closer to my goal. And it attracted catfish to me so it was always difficult knowing who to trust. The past is the past and I learned my lessons. I learned the boundaries of free speech. What was it truly that I did wrong? I said some truths that upset the public and I guided and directed those who came to me. I didn't force anyone to talk to me. And I always did my best to give others sound advice. I couldn't tell who was fake and who was real. I trusted people even though I shouldn't have. I opened myself up to be hurt by randoms and they hurt me. The Bible says that true love always trusts. Yet another bit of wisdom that proves not to be applicable to life.</p><p><br /></p><p>If I was more aware about what was happening, I would have made different decisions. But I am not wrong about our youth needing good role models. Our youth become like everybody else because they have few positive role models. We need people of virtue to stand up and share their lives with the public. Maybe I went too far to demonstrate this point. But my heart was in the right place. I seriously thought that I was doing good and not bad. It was always a race and I started late in that race. The specific age was never a concern but instead the heart and mind. It is difficult to assess other people's intentions. I have failed at this many times. Which is another reason that the public life doesn't suit me anymore. I am an emotionally vulnerable person.</p><p><br /></p><p>Stories are told in many different ways. Over twelve years I released stories about my life. The stories were not perfect because they were true stories. They were imperfect because we live in an imperfect world. Many of the stories reflected poorly on me and I chose to release them in spite of this fact. My words were taken out of context and I got in a lot of trouble for my work. I have only recently recovered from the trauma that was induced. But I had a message and I wanted to get it out. So I continued my quest in spite of the trama received. And things came to the point that I needed to put my trust in another. I did that unknowingly giving myself over to someone who did not have the best intentions for my life. I should have seen it but I was overcome in the moment.</p><p><br /></p><p>I can't do anything to change the past or I would. The events that occurred are documented in history. The events reflect badly on me and there is nothing that I can do to change that. All I can do is close off my public life and start a private one. It is my way of shaking off the bad energy. I apologise if I offended anyone with my past work. That was never my intention. I was just trying to find someone who would join me in my video and writing adventures. But I found out that this is only a one player game. So I decided to stop playing it because I only played it for meaningful interaction. The public game created haters and not fans. And none of this matters anyway because YouTube cancelled me. I lost my platform to speak a long time ago.</p><p><br /></p><p>I can't save anyone. People have to save themselves in this world. I am not a saviour. I am just a man obsessed with virtue. Do not idolise me. If you can see what I am saying then hop aboard. Together we can influence the public. Just like you, I am also a passenger on this road of life. You and I are equals. I am not better than anybody else. I am just trying my best with the life that has been given to me. The conclusions found in this book could be flawed. The only thing that I know is that I don't know anything. This work is just the ramblings of an insane person. It is not peer-reviewed. No one will back this work. No sponsor will ever have me. My name is tainted. There is nothing that I can do to fix it. I am already cancelled.</p><p><br /></p><p>The actions that I have taken do not detract from the messages conveyed in my work. It was my work that led me to take the actions that I took. The work stands on its own merit independent of any labels that are attached to me. I stand by the decisions that I took. And what is life anyways if it is not a place to make mistakes and learn from the mistakes made? I made a lot of mistakes. But I learned from them all. My mistakes made me as a person. Mistakes are very easy to learn from because they cause a bad outcome. In order to get the best outcome, you must do the best things. The things that caused a negative outcome were the wrong things to focus on. We should focus on things that bring us a positive experience. Through this refinement of character we live out the best life possible.</p>
