My journey as a writer began in the most unexpected way. I became homeless and found myself living in the wilderness, with nothing to do and no one to talk to. To pass the time, I started writing. I wrote extensively, pouring my thoughts and feelings onto the page. Eventually, I decided to compile these writings into books. Over a period of ten years, I wrote twelve books. It was a way to make use of my time and express my creativity while grappling with loneliness.<div><br></div><div>However, publishing books was far from rewarding. The main challenges were the formatting requirements. I needed a Windows computer, had to use Word to export PDFs, and ensure everything looked perfect. It was a nightmare, and nothing ever looked exactly right. Over twelve years, I sold about $100 worth of books. The frustration of dealing with these challenges and the lack of reward made writing books a daunting experience.</div><div><br></div><div>At some point, I got so frustrated with books that I stopped writing completely and focused on making videos instead. But videos couldn't always express everything I wanted to share. Some content just isn't suited for video format. I realized I needed another outlet to share more aspects of who I am. That's when I decided to start a blog. As a writer, blogging came naturally to me, and it was easy to start.</div><div><br></div><div>Writing blogs is much simpler than writing books. In a blog, you're only doing one thing at a time. A book requires an overall theme, a beginning, a middle, and an end, with each chapter contributing to the development of the book as a cohesive whole. Blogging allows me to focus on individual ideas and express them without the pressure of maintaining a complex structure.</div><div><br></div><div>I hoped that blogging on a public platform would help my ideas reach more people and allow my thoughts to live on after I'm gone. Unfortunately, just like with my books, I haven't received significant engagement or feedback. No one read my books, and so far, no one reads my blogs either. I haven't received a single comment, despite my extensive blogging.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite these challenges, I remain hopeful. My transition from books to blogs represents my journey to find a meaningful way to share my experiences and connect with others. I continue to write, driven by the desire to reach someone who might resonate with my thoughts and find value in my words.</div>
