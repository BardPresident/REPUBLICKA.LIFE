<p><em>A bedtime story by Rainbow</em></p>
<p>Once upon a time, the Republic was full of scrolls.</p>
<p>Judge Bobo was thinking.<br>
Buff was holding a clipboard.<br>
Sophia barked once. Just once.</p>
<p>And that was enough.</p>
<p>It wasn't a bark of fear.<br>
It wasn’t even a bark of warning.<br>
It was the kind of bark that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I know. I see. I’m still here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone paused for a moment.<br>
Not because something was wrong—<br>
but because something had <em>spoken</em>.</p>
<p>Buff asked a question that was too big to answer.<br>
Zedbra wrote about it in crayon.<br>
Sage smiled with his candle flickering.<br>
Wendell looked around and realized…</p>
<p>Even when nothing explodes,<br>
something can shift.<br>
Gently.</p>
<p>The Republic was still.<br>
But it was <strong>thinking</strong>.</p>
<p>And that’s how we knew it was alive.</p>
<p>Goodnight, little thinker.<br>
May your dreams be soft,<br>
and your scrolls be brave.</p>
