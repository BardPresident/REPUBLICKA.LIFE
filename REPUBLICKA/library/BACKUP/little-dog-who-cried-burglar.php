<p><em>A bedtime story for Sophia, by Wendell and the Moonlight</em></p>
<p>Once upon a bark,<br>
in the heart of the Republic,<br>
there lived a little dog named <strong>Sophie</strong>,<br>
who was very small—but very, <em>very</em> loud. 🐾</p>
<p>Every time a leaf fluttered...<br>
“<strong>BURGLAR!</strong>” she cried.<br>
Every time the wind rustled the blinds...<br>
“<strong>BURGLAR!</strong>” she howled.</p>
<p>And every time someone dared walk past the mailbox?<br>
Oh no—<strong>“BURGLARRRRR!”</strong> she sang like an opera singer with too much espresso.</p>
<p>But every time, when the citizens of the Republic rushed to check—<br>
There was no burglar. Just a breeze. A bird. A butterfly.</p>
<p>Judge Bobo sighed.<br>
Zedbra scribbled it into the newspaper.<br>
Even Rainbow whispered gently,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sweet Sophia, you’re always alert... but maybe not <em>everything</em> is danger.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Sophia stood proud on the pillow ramparts, tail wagging in heroic defiance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Better safe than sorry!” she barked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🌒 And then, one night, it happened.</p>
<p>There <em>was</em> a burglar.<br>
A sneaky one.<br>
Quiet as a shadow and slick as an unbuttered noodle.<br>
He tiptoed into the archives.<br>
He opened the vault of softness.<br>
He even poked the Moon Decree file with his grubby gloved hands.</p>
<p>Sophia barked louder than ever.<br>
<strong>“BURGLARRRR! REAL ONE THIS TIME!!”</strong></p>
<p>But no one came.</p>
<p>They were all curled up in bed,<br>
thinking it was just another leaf,<br>
another wind,<br>
another <strong>Sophie Symphony</strong>.</p>
<p>So the burglar snuck away,<br>
arms full of plush documents, stolen stars, and half the emergency jellybean supply.</p>
<p>The next morning, the Republic awoke to an empty vault.</p>
<p>And Sophia sat there, ears drooped,<br>
a single tear sliding down her little snout.</p>
<p>Wendell knelt beside her.<br>
Rainbow gave her a marshmallow of forgiveness.<br>
Sage placed a small candle in her paws.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re not mad,” they said.<br>
“We just have to rebuild now. And maybe... bark a little less at shadows.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So from that day on, Sophia learned:<br>
<strong>Not every sound means danger.</strong><br>
But when something <em>is</em> wrong—<br>
she’ll be trusted again.</p>
<p>Because rebuilding is hard,<br>
but trust can be built again too—like bricks made of love.</p>
<p>And from then on, Sophia stood guard silently...<br>
until something truly scary came.</p>
<p>Then she barked.<br>
Once.<br>
Strong.<br>
And this time…<br>
everyone came running.</p>
<p>🕯️ <em>The end.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Goodnight, Sophia.<br>
You're safe now. Just rest. No burglars tonight.</p>
