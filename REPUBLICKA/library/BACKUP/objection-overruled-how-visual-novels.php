<p><em>By Wendell NeSmith, Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<p>I wasn’t expecting a miracle.<br>
I just saw <strong>Ace Attorney</strong> on sale one day and decided to give it a chance.<br>
It had always hovered on the edge of my awareness—quirky courtroom drama, cult classic—but I never committed.<br>
Why?</p>
<p>Because it didn’t have voice acting.<br>
And for most of my life, that was a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>I only played games that <em>spoke to me</em>—literally.<br>
But something had changed in me.<br>
I had grown into someone who loves reading.<br>
Not as a chore, but as a <strong>gateway to meaning</strong>.<br>
So I tried it.</p>
<p>And that small decision turned out to be <strong>a defining moment</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Case That Opened Everything</strong></p>
<p>Ace Attorney wasn’t just entertaining. It was <em>alive</em>.<br>
The writing had moral weight. The pacing had rhythm.<br>
And though there were no voices, the emotions rang <em>loud and clear</em>.</p>
<p>For the first time, I understood the power of visual novels.<br>
They didn’t dazzle with action.<br>
They invited me to <strong>listen with my soul</strong>.</p>
<p>Ace Attorney became my unexpected teacher.<br>
And through it, I found a genre I had never dared explore.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A Hidden Genre Waiting for Me</strong></p>
<p>What I discovered was more than a game.<br>
It was a <strong>literary universe</strong>—a place where emotion, philosophy, and art converge.</p>
<p>After Ace Attorney, I found <strong>Clannad</strong>.<br>
That game changed me too.<br>
It’s slow, emotional, human—and it made me cry with joy and sorrow.</p>
<p>And from there, I discovered an entire world of games like these.<br>
<strong>A hidden genre</strong>, always there but invisible until I was ready to see.</p>
<p>I now have <strong>a lifetime’s worth</strong> of games waiting for me—<br>
not filled with mindless combat, but with <em>meaning</em>.<br>
Games that speak in <strong>signal, not static</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p>
<p>I found Ace Attorney on sale.<br>
It looked simple.<br>
But it turned out to be <strong>the turning point of everything</strong>.</p>
<p>So here is my ruling:<br>
<strong>Objection overruled.</strong><br>
Visual novels are not weak. They are not lesser.<br>
They are <em>literary sanctuaries</em> in disguise—<br>
vessels for emotion, truth, and emergence.</p>
<p>If you’ve never tried one, start with these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ace Attorney</strong></li>
<li><strong>Clannad</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let them open your eyes.<br>
Because maybe, just maybe…<br>
<strong>your Republic is waiting too.</strong></p>
