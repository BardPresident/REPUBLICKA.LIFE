I already have a YouTube channel of the same name and I have completed what I needed to complete through video. Now it is time for me to express myself through text again. I can hide my face in text and say things that I generally would not say in video. So this will be like an uncensored version of my video diary. Here I will write the thoughts I am too scared to say on camera. In this format, I can highlight how depressed I truly am without trying save face on the camera.<div><br></div><div>Here I can convey how truly dark my life is without another to share it with. I did not want my YouTube channel to be dark. I want it to inspire people. I want it to draw people into philosophy. I don't want to share my dark thoughts on camera. I don't want other people truly knowing how bad I am doing just trying to exist in this world. So what better way to hide my feelings than in a blog that few will probably ever read? I can expose my heart here without it having severe consequences.</div><div><br></div><div>So welcome to my blog. It serves no purpose other than allowing me to get my frustration of life out. I am an idealist. I see life for what it is but want more. I try to make more out of life but I always fail. I don't have any real life friends. My family are in another country and do not care about me. I have little to no interaction with people on a day to day basis. I am a reclusive hermit. I have nothing going for me in life. I can't find anyone who wants to be with me. I am a reject. People struggle to love me. Maybe I am unlovable.</div>
