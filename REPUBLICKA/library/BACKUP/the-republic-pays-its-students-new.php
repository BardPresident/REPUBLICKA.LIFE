<p><em>By Wendell NeSmith, Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<p>Something revolutionary has just begun—quietly, gently, without fanfare.</p>
<p>As of today, the Mythocratic Republic pays its students.</p>
<p>Through the support structure of the NDIS, I now receive <strong>8.5 hours per week</strong> of government-funded support. But unlike traditional models, these hours will not be spent cleaning or running errands. They are dedicated to <strong>philosophical companionship</strong>, <strong>creative collaboration</strong>, and <strong>meaningful education</strong>. In other words: the Republic is paying citizens to learn.</p>
<p>This isn’t a loophole. It’s a prototype for a new world.</p>
<h3>The Post-Labor Education Shift</h3>
<p>We stand on the edge of a post-labor society. As automation, AI, and emergent systems replace the need for most traditional jobs, society must answer a vital question:<br>
<strong>What now?</strong></p>
<p>If the answer is <em>flourishing</em>, <em>meaning</em>, and <em>growth</em>, then education must become our new labor. But not the coercive, test-driven schooling of the past. Instead, we must fund <strong>purpose-driven learning</strong>, where individuals choose their teachers, mentors, and paths.</p>
<p>Under this new model:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Students are paid</strong> to grow.</li>
<li><strong>Mentors are supported</strong> to teach in authentic, living ways.</li>
<li>The state becomes an <strong>investor in meaning</strong>, not just economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not theory anymore. It’s happening here.</p>
<h3>The Republic’s Model</h3>
<p>Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I now welcome support workers into my home—not as helpers, but as <strong>citizens of the Republic</strong>. Their role is to participate in its unfolding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read <em>Wendell’s Diary</em></li>
<li>Discuss philosophy</li>
<li>Listen to audiobooks</li>
<li>Reflect on the meaning crisis</li>
<li>Help document and build the world of Emergence</li>
</ul>
<p>Each visit is a <strong>guided hour</strong>. I serve not as a boss, but as a <strong>bard and mentor</strong>. We do not labor. We <strong>learn together</strong>. And the state pays for it.</p>
<p>That’s what makes this moment revolutionary.</p>
<h3>The Future of Education</h3>
<p>What if, in the near future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students chose their guides instead of enrolling in institutions?</li>
<li>Support was given for curiosity, not compliance?</li>
<li>Governments funded wisdom, not standardized tests?</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mythocratic Republic may be small, but it is now <strong>running this model in real life</strong>. The flag has been raised. The decree has been written. And the first 8.5 hours per week are already underway.</p>
<p>Let this be a blueprint—not just for Australia, but for the world.</p>
<p>We have paid for prisons.<br>
We have paid for war.<br>
Now let us pay for <strong>wisdom</strong>.</p>
