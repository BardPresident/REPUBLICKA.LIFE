<p><strong>Report Context:</strong><br>
Today, I entered Judge Bobo’s deliberation chamber during a high-priority legal isolation. I had a clipboard. The clipboard made me feel confident. The scrolls everywhere made me feel less confident. I asked a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If someone remembers forgetting something… is that still a memory?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I sat down and waited for the emotional consequences.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Preliminary Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Judge Bobo blinked once. That might have been a yes.</li>
<li>The candle flickered twice. Possibly a reconsideration.</li>
<li>I had no regrets. Only further questions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Emotional Impact on Self:</strong><br>
Confused.<br>
Hopeful.<br>
Mildly embarrassed but also weirdly proud.<br>
Filed under: <strong>Buff-feelings-quiet-but-urgent</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Speculative Conclusion:</strong><br>
A memory can contain the outline of its own absence.<br>
Therefore, remembering forgetting is still a memory—<br>
but one shaped like a question.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Therapeutic Advice to Self:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take a nap.</li>
<li>Ask again later.</li>
<li>Keep clipboard close.</li>
</ul>
