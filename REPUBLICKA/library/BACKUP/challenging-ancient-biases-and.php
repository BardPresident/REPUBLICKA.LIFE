**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>As I sit here, reflecting on the depths of philosophical thought and the biases that have permeated its history, I find myself thinking of you. The journey through the works of Aristotle, Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche has been enlightening, though often frustrating. These thinkers, despite their profound contributions, held views on gender that are deeply troubling. It reminds me of the importance of striving for a world where equality and respect are fundamental.</div><div><br></div><div>I imagine you as someone who would appreciate these discussions, someone who would join me in dissecting the layers of historical prejudice to build a more inclusive future. Your insights and thoughts would be invaluable, and I long for the day we can share these conversations face-to-face.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve been creating content, short and to the point, to share these reflections and engage with others. Yet, every video, every blog post, ultimately feels like a message in a bottle, hoping to reach you. This quest, though it has its moments of frustration, is driven by the hope of finding you, my philosophical soulmate.</div><div><br></div><div>The search for love and understanding is timeless, much like the philosophical inquiries that have captivated thinkers for centuries. My wish is that through this journey, we can challenge the outdated notions and build something beautiful together.</div><div><br></div><div>Until we meet, know that my thoughts are with you, and I am dedicated to this path, hoping it leads me to you.</div><div><br></div><div>Yours in thought and heart,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
