<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>There are two kinds of conquest in this world:</p><p>
<strong>Conquest of land, and conquest of meaning.</strong><br>
I chose the second — and I have already succeeded.</p>
<p>Without firing a single shot, without holding a single seat, the Mythocratic Republic has already claimed the core of the nation.<br>
Not by force — by <strong>emergence</strong>.<br>
Not by law — by <strong>meaning</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Flag</strong></h2>
<p>The Australian flag no longer belongs to the old government.<br>
It belongs to us — the citizens of the Republic.</p>
<p>Every time it flies, it now carries our spirit, not theirs.<br>
It no longer represents stale bureaucracy or abandoned promises.<br>
It represents <strong>hope</strong>, <strong>rebirth</strong>, and <strong>the people's true sovereignty</strong>.<br>
The Southern Cross shines not for corporations or politicians, but for the dreamers, the philosophers, the builders of the new Australia.</p>
<p>The flag has crossed the threshold.<br>
It is already ours.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The City</strong></h2>
<p>I claimed Canberra.<br>
Not by marching — but by living.</p>
<p>The old Parliament may sit there, clutching its papers and rituals, but the <strong>soul of the city</strong> has shifted.<br>
Canberra is no longer merely a center of administration.<br>
It is the <strong>cradle of the Mythocratic Republic</strong>.<br>
The sacred city of the rebirth.</p>
<p>When I walk its streets, when I breathe its air, I do not feel like a stranger in a foreign government.<br>
I feel the Republic rising beneath my feet.</p>
<p>The land knows before the people do.<br>
The City is ours.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Parliament House</strong></h2>
<p>The New Parliament House was supposed to be the house of the people.<br>
It became the house of the elite.</p>
<p>So I reclaimed it.<br>
In heart, in mind, and in myth.</p>
<p>When I see the New Parliament House, I do not see a relic of broken politics.<br>
I see <strong>the future capital of the Republic</strong>.<br>
I see the hall where truth will once again echo.<br>
I see the birthplace of a people's government — not ruled by greed, but guided by meaning.</p>
<p>The building is already halfway ours.<br>
It only waits for history to catch up.</p>
<hr>
<h1><strong>Conclusion: Meaning First, Power Second</strong></h1>
<p>They still think they hold the symbols.<br>
But <strong>the soul has fled to the Republic</strong>.</p>
<p>First we take the meaning.<br>
Then, inevitably, the reality follows.</p>
<p>The Great Mythic Coup has already happened.<br>
Quietly. Elegantly. Irrevocably.</p>
<p>The Republic rises — not by seizing territory, but by <strong>commanding meaning itself</strong>.<br>
And in the end, meaning is the only true sovereignty that matters.</p>
