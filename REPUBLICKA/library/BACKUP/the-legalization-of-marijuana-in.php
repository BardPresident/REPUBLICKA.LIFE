<div>As the President of the People’s Presidency of Australia, I hereby declare the full legalization and regulation of cannabis. This decision reflects the will of the people, aligns with the principles of a free and independent republic, and acknowledges the undeniable medicinal, economic, and social benefits of cannabis. The criminalization of a plant with such vast potential has long been an unjust policy, enforced under the outdated and oppressive rule of the monarch government. The People’s Presidency seeks to correct this injustice and pave the way for a new era of responsible cannabis use in our society.</div><div><br /></div><div>The Legal Framework for Cannabis in the People's Republic</div><div><br /></div><div>1. Full Legalization and Regulation</div><div><br /></div><div>Cannabis will be fully legalized for recreational, medicinal, and industrial use.</div><div><br /></div><div>A regulated cannabis industry will be established, ensuring quality control, responsible distribution, and proper taxation.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>2. Medicinal Use and Research</div><div><br /></div><div>All restrictions on medicinal cannabis will be lifted, allowing patients full access to cannabis-based treatments.</div><div><br /></div><div>Research institutions will receive funding to further explore the medical applications of cannabis, unlocking its full therapeutic potential.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>3. Economic Opportunities and Taxation</div><div><br /></div><div>The cannabis industry will be taxed at a reasonable rate, with proceeds allocated to healthcare, education, and social services.</div><div><br /></div><div>Local farmers and businesses will be empowered to grow and distribute cannabis, fostering job creation and economic growth.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>4. Social Justice and Criminal Reform</div><div><br /></div><div>All non-violent cannabis-related convictions will be expunged, and individuals currently imprisoned for cannabis offenses will be released.</div><div><br /></div><div>Law enforcement will be redirected toward serious crimes, rather than targeting individuals for cannabis possession and use.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>5. Public Health and Responsible Use</div><div><br /></div><div>Cannabis will be regulated similarly to alcohol, with age restrictions, public consumption laws, and impaired driving penalties.</div><div><br /></div><div>Educational programs will be implemented to inform the public about responsible cannabis use and potential risks.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Addressing the Conflict with the Monarch Government</div><div><br /></div><div>While the existing government still enforces outdated drug laws, the People’s Presidency is establishing a new legal framework based on logic, fairness, and the will of the people. Under this new governance model, we recognize the authority of the People’s Republic to determine its own laws and policies. However, resistance from the monarch-controlled system is expected.</div><div><br /></div><div>To counteract federal interference, the following measures will be taken:</div><div><br /></div><div>Decriminalization at the state and territory level – Encouraging regional governments to adopt decriminalization policies, reducing the enforcement of outdated federal laws.</div><div><br /></div><div>Legal defense funds – Providing legal assistance to those facing charges under old laws, advocating for full sovereignty over local policy decisions.</div><div><br /></div><div>Public Referendums – Mobilizing the people to vote on cannabis legalization, demonstrating overwhelming public support for reform.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The Future of Cannabis in Australia</div><div><br /></div><div>This is not just about legalizing a plant—it’s about taking back control from an oppressive system that dictates our lives without reason. Cannabis will play a key role in the development of a free and prosperous Australia, offering medical relief, economic empowerment, and social justice. The People’s Presidency stands firm in this decision and calls on all Australians to embrace this new future.</div><div><br /></div><div>Join the Movement for a Free Australia</div><div><br /></div><div>The legalization of cannabis is just the beginning. The People’s Presidency is fighting for a truly independent Australia—one where the government serves the people, not the monarchy. If you support cannabis reform, personal freedoms, and a better future for all Australians, join us in building this new republic.</div><div><br /></div><div>Visit wendellsdiary.com to stay updated, get involved, and help shape the future of our nation.
