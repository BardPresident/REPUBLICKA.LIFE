There’s a whole world out there, teeming with life and activity, yet here I am, existing independently of it. Despite my best efforts, it often feels like I’m not part of the world at all.<div><br></div><div>Over the years, I’ve poured my heart and soul into creating content. I’ve made countless videos, written books, maintained a blog, and even set up a forum. I’ve written extensively and produced numerous videos, but the audience remains elusive. Hardly anyone watches the videos, reads the blog, or engages with the forum.</div><div><br></div><div>So why do I keep going? Because I hold onto the hope that one day, there will be a beautiful, miraculous moment when everything clicks. Suddenly, I’ll have an audience, and people will see me. It’s this hope that keeps me working hard, even when it feels like I’m invisible.</div><div><br></div><div>I do have a few fans, but they are few and far between. However, I know my content is awesome. I believe it’s worth reading and watching. I’m convinced that what I’m doing is important and has the potential to help humanity significantly. If only I could connect with people, I could contribute greatly to human existence and its betterment.</div><div><br></div><div>Recognition would mean everything to me. My life is almost perfect right now. The only thing lacking is friends and people to discuss philosophy with. If I found an audience and people to share philosophical discussions with, my life would be perfect.</div><div><br></div><div>In my old work, I did experience some recognition, but it was for being weird, and it wasn’t the kind of attention I wanted. I had haters and stalkers, and it was a really horrible experience. Yet, despite these challenges, I keep pushing forward, driven by the belief that someday, things will change.</div>
