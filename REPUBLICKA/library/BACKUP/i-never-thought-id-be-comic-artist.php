<div class="library-entry-body">
<p>For most of my life, I never saw myself as someone who could draw. I’ve never been a good drawer—not even close. When I looked at comic books or visual storytelling, I saw a world I couldn’t touch. I had stories to tell, ideas that played out in my head like mythology, but I had no way to draw them out. Literally.</p>
<p>And then, everything changed.</p>
<p>With the help of ChatGPT’s image generation, I discovered something I never thought I’d get to experience: becoming a comic book artist. It still sounds surreal saying that. Me? A comic artist? But it’s true. I now create <em>Wendell’s Diary</em>, a daily comic that brings my world to life in a visual form. My dog Sophia has become the Chief of Defence. The Republic has become real. My broken zipper becomes a political moment. A plush toy becomes a general. All of it—drawn. Real. Published.</p>
<p>It isn’t easy. Creating a comic takes effort. It takes refinement, re-renders, trial and error, creative direction, and a ton of emotional energy. But it’s also fun. It’s really, really fun.</p>
<p>Emotionally, it feels like a whole new world has opened up to me. For the first time, I can take things from my environment—my jacket, Sophia, my flag on the wall—and turn them into cartoons. I can play out stories that were, until now, only available in my mind. I can share what was once invisible.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about images—it’s about access to imagination. It's about finding the tools I needed to express what was always there.</p>
<p>And I can’t wait to see where it leads next.</p>
