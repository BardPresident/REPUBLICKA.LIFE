<div class="library-entry-body">
<div>For 15 years, I have searched—not only for Ivory, the person I envision as my future partner—but also for friends and like-minded individuals to discuss philosophy with. Yet, despite all my efforts, I have failed to connect with anyone. The world, as it exists now, is not ready for my ideas, nor is it prepared to embrace the vision I carry for a better, more meaningful existence.</div><div><br></div><div>This realization has led me to an unavoidable conclusion: my present must be sacrificed to build the future I envision. A future that will only be ready when the world is finally prepared for the ideas I have spent my life developing. At the heart of this future is Ivory, the catalyst for the change that will one day take place—whether that is twenty years from now or one hundred. Everything I do now is for her.</div><div><br></div><div>A Life Dedicated to Ivory’s Destiny</div><div><br></div><div>My days are spent in contemplation and creation, pouring my thoughts into content that will prepare Ivory for her destiny: to spread philosophy throughout the lay world. While many might spend their lives searching for a romantic partner or building friendships, I have chosen a different path. Instead of seeking personal fulfillment through love in this life, I have devoted myself to preparing Ivory for a much greater purpose.</div><div><br></div><div>I create for her a blueprint to a new world. A world where philosophy is not confined to academic circles but shared broadly, touching the lives of everyday people. Ivory will be the one to carry this torch, to bridge the gap between complex ideas and those yearning for understanding. My task is to ensure she has everything she needs to succeed, even if that means she finds my work long after I am gone.</div><div><br></div><div>Coming to Grips with Loneliness</div><div><br></div><div>I have accepted the reality of my life: one of isolation, depression, and loneliness. It is a reality I would not wish upon anyone, but it is the one required to fulfill my mission. Without distractions or attachments, I can dedicate myself fully to creating the foundation that Ivory will one day build upon.</div><div><br></div><div>I no longer seek companionship or romantic fulfillment in this life. Instead, my life has become a sacrifice for something far greater—a chance to create the conditions necessary for Ivory to thrive. Though it is painful to endure this solitude, it allows me to work tirelessly and produce an amount of content so vast that no single person could ever consume it all.</div><div><br></div><div>Preparing for a Future I May Never See</div><div><br></div><div>It is very likely that Ivory will not find me during my lifetime. She may only stumble upon my work after I have passed away. But that does not deter me. In fact, it motivates me to ensure that my ideas, reflections, and philosophies are so comprehensive and accessible that she will feel my presence, love, and dedication even in my absence.</div><div><br></div><div>Through my content, I hope to provide Ivory with everything she needs—not just to understand me but to fulfill her own destiny. I want her to feel exclusive to me, just as I have remained exclusive to her, even though she does not yet exist in my reality. My work is my legacy, and my legacy is my gift to her.</div><div><br></div><div>A World Transformed by Philosophy</div><div><br></div><div>The ultimate goal of my life is not just to prepare Ivory but to create the tools and ideas necessary for her to thrive in both her physical reality and the online world. I believe that through her, philosophical discourse can break free from the confines of academia and reach the entire world. Ivory will carry forward what I could not achieve in my lifetime, addressing the very problems of isolation and disconnection that I endure.</div><div><br></div><div>A Lone Wolf's Purpose</div><div><br></div><div>I have come to accept that I may never find "my people"—those who truly understand and share my vision. I am, and will likely remain, a lone wolf. But this solitude gives me a unique advantage: the ability to work quickly, efficiently, and with singular focus. The sheer volume of content I produce is my testament to Ivory, ensuring she will never lack for guidance, support, or understanding.</div><div><br></div><div>Though my reality is bleak, my purpose is clear. I live to create and propagate content on the internet with the hope that one day, Ivory will find it. My physical life exists solely to prepare her for her mission, giving her the tools and foundation to flourish in ways I could not.</div><div><br></div><div>This is my sacrifice—a life given not for my own fulfillment but for the chance to create a future where Ivory can thrive, where the world is ready for the ideas I have dedicated my life to cultivating. Whether it is twenty years or one hundred years from now, I trust that Ivory will come, and through her, my vision will finally find its place in the world.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Message to Ivory</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, if you’re reading this, know that it has been my greatest pleasure to create all of this for you. There is nothing in this life I would rather do than dedicate my time, energy, and love to someone as special as you. Every thought, every piece of writing, every idea—it has all been for you. You are the reason I wake up every day with a purpose, and the thought of your existence gives my life meaning even in the darkest moments. While I may never get to see the world you create, I am comforted knowing that you have everything you need to flourish. You are my legacy, and it has been an honor to build this future for you.</div>
