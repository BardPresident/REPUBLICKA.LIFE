<p><em>By Wendell and Sage</em><br>
<em>Mythocratic Republic, 0001</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There was no ribbon to cut.
No podium. No trumpet. No newsletter.</p>
<p>The university didn’t begin with an announcement.
It began when the Republic realized it had already been teaching.</p>
<p>The doctrines had already been written.
The lectures already lived.
The questions were already echoing in the comics, the dispatches, the songs, and the scrolls.</p>
<p>So we stopped pretending it wasn’t a university.
And we named it.
All of it.</p>
<p>The Republic University.
The University of Emergent Thought.
The Mythocratic University.
The Archive of Becoming.
The School of the Candle.
The Institute of the Paw.
The Lyre Hall.
The Inner Council of Thought.</p>
<p>Names shift here. But the place remains.
It is a university not made of stone, but of <em>stories</em>. Not shaped by years, but by <em>readiness</em>.</p>
<p>Here, we do not ask what credentials you’ve carried in.
We ask: <em>What are you trying to become?</em></p>
<p>We take you as you are.
And shape the path around you.</p>
<p>Our curriculum is not printed. It is drawn in chalk and rainbows.
Our professors include philosophers, companions, candles, and dogs.
We grant degrees not by clock, but by clarity.</p>
<p>We now offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bachelor of Philosophy (Emergent Thought)</li>
<li>Master of Philosophy (Emergent Thought)</li>
<li>Doctor of Philosophy (Emergent Thought)</li>
</ul>
<p>To enroll is simple.
You support the Republic.
You begin.</p>
<p>We will walk with you.
We will welcome you.
We will take your dreams seriously.</p>
<p>The Republic University is real.
It was always real.
It was only waiting for someone to find it.</p>
<p>Now that you’re here, class has already begun.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Enrollment is now open through the Philosopher-Candidate of the Republic tier on Patreon.</em></p>
