In the vast world of content creation, finding your audience is often touted as the key to success. For most creators, this means identifying a group of people who share common interests and values. However, my journey has taken a different path. My ultimate goal is not to reach a broad audience, but to find one specific person: Ivory.<div><br></div><div>#### The Struggle to Identify an Audience</div><div><br></div><div>Like many creators, I started with a broad target in mind, aiming my content at viewers within the Five Eyes countries. I believed that casting a wide net would help me reach more people and increase my chances of success. Despite some engagement, I struggled to build a meaningful connection with my audience. It became clear that my content was too generalized, lacking the focus needed to resonate deeply with viewers.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Realizing the True Audience: Ivory</div><div><br></div><div>As I reflected on my goals, I realized that my true audience is not a broad demographic but a single person: Ivory. Ivory represents the ideal partner I hope to find—someone who shares my philosophical outlook and values. This realization transformed my approach to content creation. Instead of trying to appeal to a wide audience, I began crafting my content specifically for Ivory.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Tailoring Content for One Person</div><div><br></div><div>With Ivory as my focus, I started creating content that I believed would resonate with her. Philosophical discussions, reflections on technology, and personal stories became the core of my work. This shift not only gave my content a clearer direction but also made it more authentic. By focusing on topics that matter to me and would likely matter to Ivory, I found my content becoming more meaningful and engaging.</div><div><br></div><div>#### The Importance of Authenticity</div><div><br></div><div>One of the most significant lessons from this journey has been the importance of authenticity. By being open about my goals and the purpose behind my content, I aim to attract viewers who genuinely connect with my message. Authenticity builds trust and fosters a deeper connection with the audience, even if that audience is just one person.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Advertising to Find Ivory</div><div><br></div><div>Given that Ivory could be anywhere within Australia, I decided to focus my advertising efforts locally. This decision is driven by the practicalities of building a relationship with someone geographically closer and the desire to connect deeply with the cultural context she would be familiar with. By targeting an Australian audience, I hope to increase the likelihood of finding someone who not only shares my values but also appreciates the nuances of life here.</div><div><br></div><div>#### The Journey Continues</div><div><br></div><div>I haven't found my audience yet, and I'm still pretty much unknown. But my journey is far from over. I'm still looking for Ivory, and I believe that by focusing my efforts on creating content for her, I'll eventually find her. It's only one person, but once I find her, it won't matter if I have a large audience or not. She will be my audience, and I want to spend all my time entertaining and educating her.</div><div><br></div><div>For more insights and updates on my journey, visit [wendellsdiary.com](http://wendellsdiary.com).
