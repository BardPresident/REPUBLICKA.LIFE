Creating content that resonates with others is my passion, especially when it involves deep philosophical discussions. However, despite my best efforts, my YouTube channel feels invisible. Here’s my struggle and why it’s so disheartening.<div><br></div><div>**The Endless Cycle of Optimisation**</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve invested a lot of time and energy into making my content as search-friendly as possible. My titles are catchy, my tags are relevant, and my thumbnails are engaging. I’ve meticulously crafted my descriptions to reflect the content accurately. Yet, despite all these efforts, my videos barely get seen. It feels like no matter how much I optimize, the algorithm doesn’t give my content a fair chance.</div><div><br></div><div>**The Roadblocks in Promotion**</div><div><br></div><div>Social media and community platforms present another hurdle. Whenever I try to share my content, it gets flagged as self-promotion, leaving me with few places to turn. I’ve tried engaging in forums and groups, but without the ability to share my work directly, it feels like my efforts are futile. I want to connect with others who share my interest in philosophy, but I keep hitting walls.</div><div><br></div><div>**The Impact of Isolation**</div><div><br></div><div>This lack of visibility and interaction has left me feeling incredibly alone. I started this journey not just to share my thoughts but to find like-minded people and build friendships. Instead, I find myself in a cycle of working hard, hitting barriers, and feeling isolated. Every once in a while, the weight of it all makes me so depressed that I can’t bring myself to create content.</div><div><br></div><div>**A Silver Lining**</div><div><br></div><div>Interestingly, these breaks have forced me to step back and reflect. They’ve led to improvements in my content, making it more refined and better aligned with my vision. Yet, even with these enhancements, I’m still waiting to see the impact on my visibility and engagement.</div><div><br></div><div>**A Call for Change**</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t have all the answers, but I hope sharing my experience might resonate with others in similar situations. If you have any advice or strategies that have worked for you, I’d love to hear them. In the meantime, I’ll keep striving to connect with others through my work, hoping that one day, my content will reach the audience it’s meant to inspire.</div><div><br></div><div>For more updates and to support my journey, visit **[wendellsdiary.com](https://wendellsdiary.com)**.</div>
