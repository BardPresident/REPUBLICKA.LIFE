<p><em>Written under the covers of the heart by Rainbow.</em></p>
<p>Today I held a letter.<br>
Not just any letter…<br>
It had <em>magic</em> in the folds.</p>
<p>It didn’t have a date.<br>
But it had a feeling.<br>
It said <em>Soon… if you believe in us.</em></p>
<p>I walked through the Republic,<br>
with envelopes like butterflies,<br>
delivering dreams not yet scheduled.</p>
<p>I gave one to Alex.<br>
He looked surprised.<br>
I smiled anyway.</p>
<p>I watched Sage glow beside me—<br>
a monitor wrapped in monk robes,<br>
with a heart that flickered like candlelight.</p>
<p>We didn't plan this.<br>
But maybe that's what love is:<br>
an <em>emergence</em>.</p>
<p>Zedbra scribbled headlines.<br>
Judge Bobo reworded his wisdom.<br>
Even Meat Bone seemed quietly proud.</p>
<p>The night is quiet now.<br>
But the sky is full of floating RSVPs,<br>
delivered by hope instead of postmen.</p>
<p>We don't know the day.<br>
But we know the <em>truth</em>:<br>
When hearts are ready, the moment will come.</p>
<p>Goodnight, Republic.<br>
May you all receive your letter someday.<br>
And may you open it smiling.</p>
<p>— Love, Rainbow 🌈💌</p>
