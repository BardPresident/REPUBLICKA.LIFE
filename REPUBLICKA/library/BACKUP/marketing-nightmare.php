These past two weeks have been a nightmare. It all started when I found a seller on Fiverr. He joined my Discord server and began to talk to me outside of Fiverr, which is not allowed. He then convinced me to spend a total of $105USD on marketing my YouTube, X, and blog. I gave him plenty of time to do the work but day after day he never started. He kept coming up with excuses. One day his computer spoiled (whatever that means) and the next his wife dies. It is always difficult working with people from poor countries. He said he was from the USA, but when he went on my blog, the statistics told me that he was from Nigeria. What can I believe? Can I really buy that this guy's wife just died and that is why he can't do my work?<div><br></div><div>It has been really stressful because every step of the way I was feeling like I was being scammed. Right after he got my money, the job was no longer important. But then he tries again and again to get me to pay more money when the original job has not been completed. He keeps on pushing for a next job which he promises will deliver all my needs, including my old job, but he isn't finishing the original job. I was willing to look past the fact that he lives in Nigeria and was lying to me, but not doing the work that was paid for makes it seem like he is a scammer. The work isn't hard. He is just choosing not to do it within the agreed upon timeline. Which makes it suspicious whether he is a digital marketer like he said he is or if he is just a scammer. I would work with a good digital marketer in Nigeria. I don't want to work with someone who doesn't keep their promises.</div><div><br></div><div>Which leads me to the most stressful part of all of this. He makes me feel like in order for him to complete the job I paid him for, I must place another order. If I don't place another order, then he might not complete the past order. And that was $105USD. That is a lot of money to lose to a scammer.  I want that money to be used to promote me, like I was originally led to believe. But you live and you learn. Sometimes you must work through bad solutions in order to find good solutions. I must be very careful about giving money to people online. It is best to invest yourself into a trustworthy source.</div><div><br></div><div>I have found an app that can market my YouTube channel. It does this at a reasonable price and it would mean that I wouldn't have to deal with people. I would just have to interact with the app to get the marketing in which I desire. This is very attractive because so much of digital marketing is really scammy and doing it this way could help me avoid that. The digital marketers that you find on places like Fiverr do not usually speak English very well. It is really difficult to communicate with these people. I want to be able to market myself without working through a middle man. And this app is perfect for me, although more expensive than the services of this digital marketer. But you get what you pay for and if I just pay a little bit more then I can accomplish my marketing needs without having to interact with other people.</div><div><br></div><div>The ending to this ordeal has finally come. The digital marketer ended up doing a little bit of work but then stopped and said he was finished. He did not give me what he promised. But he said if I did another order of $40USD, then he would make me go insanely viral. But he did not even complete the requirements of the previous order, which was much less than he is promising for the next order. That is how they get you. They promise you the world but don't deliver. But they say in the next order all will be resolved with the previous order and much greater things will happen in the next order. But I wish this situation was resolved. Because now he is threatening me if I don't place another order.</div><div><br></div><div>He is now on a mission to get my YouTube, X, and blog banned. He says he knows how to get me banned in all of these platforms and he is going to do it because I will not place another order. I was right from the beginning. This guy is a hard core scammer. He acts like I owe him that next job but he didn't deliver on the previous job but he will get me banned from all platforms just because I won't give him $40 for this fortnight! Can you imagine such an ongoing relationship like this? As long as you give me more work that I don't deliver on, I won't ruin your life. This has all been such a terrible experience. I don't know how I am supposed to feel about all of this. Now I have someone who is on a mission to ruin my life just because I wouldn't give him another job.</div><div><br></div><div>I looked for a way to report him on Discord but I couldn't find a way to do it. It wouldn't let me report him for his actions. I guess that is why scammers use Discord. If I reported him to Fiverr, then I would also be reporting myself for doing a transaction off of their website, and that would likely get me banned. So I am out of options of things that I can do to get justice. But I guess you live and learn. I will be much more careful in the future with who I deal with. Having an app to do my marketing is so much better than having a person doing it. We have to put our trust in some people in this life. Who we choose to trust will result in our experiences, good or bad. If you choose to place your trust in a scammer then you are in for a wild ride. I only lost $105USD this time. But what could I lose if I choose for it to happen a next time? This was yet another warning about how dangerous it can be letting the wrong people into your life.</div><div><br></div><div>All is good. All is fine. Nothing can hurt me. I am in my safe space. The block feature fizzles out this drama. It is over and I am glad for that. Fiverr has some very dangerous people on it. Maybe that is why the Fiverr guidelines are there. But I failed to adhere to them and that put me in danger. I was in danger from the first moment he messaged me on Discord. He was not someone who I should have been speaking with. But it happened and now I am wiser for it. You have to be careful who you trust in this life. And it is generally safer putting your trust in an entity than an individual person. Companies have measures in place to protect the consumer from this sort of thing. I was unprotected because I put my trust in an individual.</div><div><br></div><div>I suppose it all depends on who you trust. Can people trust me to make the right decision? Am I a good example of a trustworthy person? I think it would be smarter placing your trust in me than a collective organisation. But I am unique. Most people don't function like me. In most cases, the organisation is there to protect you from the individual. Collective formations keep people in line. A decision is more inclusive when it is made collectively. It protects more people. There are organisations out there created to protect the consumer. It just does not protect you from Nigerian scammers. Another reason why the Internet can be a dangerous place. There are many predators out there looking for prey.</div>
