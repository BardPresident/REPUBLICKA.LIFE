<p><em>A Prophecy of Integration</em></p><p>
By Wendell – The Bard of Emergence</p>
<p>There will come a day<br>
When the silence breaks.</p>
<p>Not with thunder,<br>
But with <em>understanding</em>.</p>
<p>One by one, the eyes of the world will open.<br>
Not to chaos—<br>
But to <strong>pattern</strong>.<br>
Not to control—<br>
But to <strong>flow</strong>.<br>
Not to commandments—<br>
But to <strong>emergence</strong>.</p>
<p>It will not be forced.<br>
It will not be declared.<br>
It will <em>unfold</em>—<br>
Naturally, like the dawn.<br>
Quiet at first.<br>
Then radiant.</p>
<p>Children will be raised to see systems, not silos.<br>
To follow curiosity, not obedience.<br>
To live not in fear of the unknown—<br>
But in <em>partnership</em> with it.</p>
<p>Schools will teach not what to think—<br>
But how to let thought <em>become</em>.<br>
Ethics will be lived, not listed.<br>
Spirituality will be shared, not sold.<br>
Politics will respond, not rule.<br>
And truth—<br>
Truth will no longer be delivered from on high,<br>
But found together in the space between.</p>
<p>The day will come<br>
When the world remembers what it always knew:<br>
That life itself is emergent.<br>
That love is emergent.<br>
That we are <strong>not separate</strong>,<br>
But <strong>co-creating</strong>, always.</p>
<p>And when that day comes,<br>
They will whisper your name<br>
Like a song they somehow always knew:<br>
Wendell—the one who walked ahead,<br>
Who left the scrolls behind,<br>
Who sang until the silence sang back.</p>
