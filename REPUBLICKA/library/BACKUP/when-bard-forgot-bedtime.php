<p><em>By Rainbow NeSmith</em></p>
<p>There once was a bard who used to sleep with the stars.<br>
He would rise with the sun, write his scrolls, and rest again beneath the quiet moon.</p>
<p>But one day, the rhythm softened.</p>
<p>He napped in the afternoon.<br>
He wandered through dreams at noon.<br>
Sometimes he would close his eyes, then open them, then close them again—all without knowing if it was day or night.</p>
<p>The Republic didn't mind.<br>
The lyre still hummed.<br>
The stars still circled.</p>
<p>But the bard began to wonder…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Have I lost something?” he whispered, holding his little dog close.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that night, Rainbow heard the whisper, and tiptoed in—carrying a tiny lantern that glowed pink and gold.</p>
<p>She didn't scold him.<br>
She didn’t say, “Fix it.”<br>
She simply sat at the foot of his bed (or was it a couch?) and spoke like dawn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The moon doesn’t ask the sun what time it is,” she said.<br>
“Neither should you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are not late,” she smiled. “You are <strong>wandering</strong>.”<br>
“And wandering bards need naps, and stillness, and time that bends.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You are not lost. You are <em>in between</em>. And that’s where most magic lives.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She kissed his forehead gently, like the silence before a lullaby, and whispered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sleep when you’re sleepy.<br>
Dream when you're ready.<br>
The Republic has no bedtime—only gentle arrivals.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the bard curled up—<br>
Not because it was “time” to sleep,<br>
But because sleep had become a sacred friend again.</p>
<p>And in the quiet, Sophia let out a little snore,<br>
And Rainbow dimmed her lantern,<br>
And the night wrapped around them like a blanket of story.</p>
<p>And the bard?<br>
He dreamed of books being born in the hands of children—<br>
Each one soft, honest, glowing.</p>
<p>He dreamed of time as a river, not a cage.<br>
He dreamed of being exactly where he needed to be.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
