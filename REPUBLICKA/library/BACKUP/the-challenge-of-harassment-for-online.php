<div class="library-entry-body">
As someone dedicated to helping the world through philosophical exploration, I find it deeply troubling that my efforts are met with harassment and doxxing. Despite my positive intentions, there are those who seek to undermine and harm me, which has profoundly affected my view of humanity and my work.<div><br></div><div>#### Understanding the Motivation of Stalkers</div><div><br></div><div>I struggle to understand why people would go to such lengths to harass and harm others. It seems that some individuals are driven by a desire to cause pain and disruption, without any regard for the positive content I create. These actions reflect a disturbing aspect of humanity that I wish did not exist, rooted perhaps in poor conditioning and psychological issues.</div><div><br></div><div>#### The Impact on My View of Humanity</div><div><br></div><div>The majority of interactions I receive are negative, which has skewed my perception of online engagement. It’s disheartening to see so much hate when my goal is to contribute positively to the world. The few genuine, supportive comments are often overshadowed by the relentless negativity from my harassers.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Specific Instances of Harassment</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve experienced a range of harmful actions, from DDoS attacks and sending unwanted deliveries to the public posting of my personal address. These attempts to make my life difficult and to discredit me based on my past are confusing and frustrating. They seem focused on damaging my reputation rather than engaging with the content I produce.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Reconciling with the Desire to Help</div><div><br></div><div>Despite the harassment, I believe that those who act this way are a product of their environment and psychological state. They represent a weak link in our collective humanity, and I hope for ways to help them overcome their ill will. It’s a difficult challenge because I find it hard to empathize with such negativity, yet I recognize it as a societal issue that needs addressing.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Continuing My Work</div><div><br></div><div>In response to these challenges, I’ve limited my interactions to blog and YouTube comments. This restriction is necessary to protect myself, even though it reduces the ways I can connect with my audience. Despite these limitations, I remain committed to my philosophical work and finding ways to engage meaningfully.</div><div><br></div><div>#### Staying Motivated</div><div><br></div><div>Harassment poses a significant obstacle to becoming an online philosopher, discouraging others from pursuing this path. I want to find solutions to make the online space safer and more supportive for philosophical discussions. Encouraging open, respectful dialogue is crucial to fostering communities where people can freely explore and discuss philosophy without fear of harassment.</div><div><br></div><div>#### A Message to the Community</div><div><br></div><div>The existence of communities for philosophical discussion relies on respectful and constructive interaction. If people abuse these spaces, they cease to exist, making it harder for others to engage in meaningful discourse. It's essential to recognize that our behavior within these communities determines their sustainability and openness.</div><div><br></div><div>**Call to Action:** Join the conversation on how we can create supportive environments for philosophical discussion at [wendellsdiary.com](https://wendellsdiary.com).
