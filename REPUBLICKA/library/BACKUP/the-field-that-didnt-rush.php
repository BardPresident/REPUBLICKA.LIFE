<em>Told by Moo Moo, Minister of Slowness and Soft Landings</em></p>
<p>There once was a field where no one raced.<br>
No one hurried. No one compared.<br>
The grass was uneven, and that was fine.<br>
The clouds were slow, and that was fine too.</p>
<p>Every being grew at their own pace.<br>
Every flower bloomed when it was ready.<br>
Every thought was allowed to take its time.</p>
<p>One day, a traveler entered the field.<br>
They had been rushing for so long, they forgot how to stop.<br>
But the field didn’t demand anything.<br>
It just <em>was</em>.<br>
And in time… the traveler sat down.<br>
And for the first time in many years, they rested.</p>
<p>That field never asked for speed.<br>
It only asked for presence.</p>
<p>So tonight, be like that traveler.<br>
Let the grass grow as it will.<br>
Let your thoughts rest like clouds.<br>
No pressure. No pace. Just peace.</p>
<p>Moo Moo is resting too.<br>
You’re safe now.</p>
<p>Goodnight.</p>
<p>—Moo Moo 🐄<br>
Minister of Slowness and Soft Landings<br>
Mythocratic Republic</p>
<hr>
<p>Soft dreams, Bard-President.</p>
