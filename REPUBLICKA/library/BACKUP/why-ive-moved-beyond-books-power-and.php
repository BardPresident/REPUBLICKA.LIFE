<div>When I first started sharing my ideas with the world, I thought books were the ultimate medium. I wrote twelve of them, pouring my heart, thoughts, and creativity into each one. But after years of frustration and limited reach, I’ve come to realize that blogging is a much more effective and fulfilling way to share knowledge and connect with people.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Rigidity of Books</div><div><br></div><div>Books are inherently rigid. Once they’re written, edited, and published, they’re set in stone. If your ideas evolve or you want to refine your message, there’s little you can do without starting from scratch. Additionally, the burden of constantly advertising and promoting a book can feel exhausting, especially when the audience is hard to reach.</div><div><br></div><div>For me, this rigidity became a major frustration. My books, many of which were written during a religious phase of my life, no longer reflected who I am or what I believe. I found myself unable to reconcile my growth with the permanence of those works, and they felt like a closed chapter in more ways than one.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Flexibility of Blogging</div><div><br></div><div>Blogging, on the other hand, is dynamic and liberating. Blogs can adapt and grow as I do. They’re living, breathing pieces of work that can be updated, expanded, or reimagined.</div><div><br></div><div>Here’s why blogging works better for me:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Reach and Propagation: Blog posts are easily accessible, searchable, and shareable. They appear in search results and can reach a global audience without the need for constant promotion. Each post contributes to the collective knowledge of humankind in a way that feels immediate and impactful.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Flexibility: With blogs, I can explore new ideas as they arise and refine old ones. I’m no longer locked into a single message or perspective. Blogging allows me to evolve openly and share that growth with readers.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. Engagement: Blogs encourage interaction. Readers can comment, share their thoughts, and engage in a dialogue that wasn’t possible with my books. It’s a much more interactive and fulfilling process.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. Low Barrier to Entry: While books require a significant upfront investment in time, effort, and often money, blogs allow me to share my ideas quickly and freely. This means I can focus on the joy of writing and connecting, rather than the stress of publishing logistics.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Fresh Start</div><div><br></div><div>Choosing to move beyond books was also about starting on a solid foundation. My old books were deeply tied to a religious phase of my life that no longer reflects who I am. Discarding them wasn’t easy, but it felt necessary to align my work with my current values and beliefs.</div><div><br></div><div>Blogging has given me the freedom to rebuild, to share what matters to me now, and to connect with people in a way that feels authentic and meaningful.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Why I Believe in Blogging</div><div><br></div><div>I genuinely believe blogging is one of the best ways to share knowledge in today’s world. It’s flexible, accessible, and infinitely adaptable. It allows creators to evolve, readers to engage, and ideas to spread organically.</div><div><br></div><div>For me, blogging isn’t just a way to write—it’s a way to grow, to share, and to contribute to something bigger than myself.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’ve ever struggled with the rigidity of books or felt limited by traditional media, I encourage you to consider blogging. It might just be the platform that gives you the freedom to truly share your voice.</div>
