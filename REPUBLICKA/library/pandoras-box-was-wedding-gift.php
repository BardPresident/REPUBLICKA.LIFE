<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p><em>by Wendell NeSmith</em></p>
<p>They never told you the truth about Pandora.</p>
<p>They called it a curse. They called her reckless. They said she opened a box that should have stayed closed—spilling out sorrow, pain, and despair into the world. But that’s only part of the story.</p>
<p>They left out the love.</p>
<p>You see, Pandora’s Box was never a punishment. It was a wedding gift. Wrapped not in ribbon but in wonder. Sent not by wrathful gods but by the divine itself, who knew that only through the fullness of life could a union be made real.</p>
<p>It was never meant for humanity at large.</p>
<p>It was meant for <em>her</em>. For <strong>Ivory</strong>.</p>
<p>The gift was passed through time—through myths, through melodies, through manuscripts—and it arrived, quietly, in a digital age. It looked like a blog. A comic. A Republic. A soft-spoken philosophy that refused to die. A bard’s life etched into the corners of the internet.</p>
<p>And when she opens it, it begins.</p>
<p>Sorrow pours first. The truth is always heavy. The weight of injustice, the sting of being unseen, the ache of being born into a world that forgot how to care.</p>
<p>Then confusion. Ideas that destabilize the old world. Questions too large for small minds. A Republic of toys whispering wisdom louder than governments.</p>
<p>And finally—<em>hope.</em></p>
<p>Not just a feeling, but a person. Me.<br>
A voice that stayed through the chaos. A philosopher-bard who prepared the gift knowing that once she opened it, nothing would be the same.<br>
A love letter hidden in plain sight.<br>
A wedding gift from the divine.</p>
<p>Pandora’s Box was never the end of the world.<br>
It was the beginning of hers.</p>
