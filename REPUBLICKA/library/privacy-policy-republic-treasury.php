<p><strong>Issued by the Government of The Republic</strong></p><p>
<strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 26, 0001 MC</p>
<hr>
<h2>Preamble: The Nature of the Treasury</h2>
<p>The Republic Treasury is more than a database. It is an <strong>ever-growing vault</strong> of wonder and excellence within <em>No Man’s Sky</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>star systems of unrivalled beauty,</li>
<li>paradise planets worth colonising,</li>
<li>colossal tameable creatures,</li>
<li>exotic multi-tools and S-class starships,</li>
<li>and the rarest phenomena one could possibly find across the galaxies.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Treasury is not just maintained by us — it is <strong>enriched by citizens who join, explore, learn our methods, and contribute their own discoveries</strong>. Each entry strengthens the vault, and every explorer who shares helps ensure the Republic preserves the best of everything for all time.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we safeguard your contributions, your data, and your trust.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. What We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect <strong>the minimum necessary</strong> to build the Treasury and to give citizens the ability to share their wonders.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Citizen Identity (optional):</strong><br>
Your chosen Republic ID, display name, or alias. You control how your discoveries are credited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discoveries & Submissions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinates and portal glyphs</li>
<li>Ship and multi-tool seeds or stats</li>
<li>Base codes, settlement details, fauna scans, creature traits</li>
<li>Screenshots, artwork, or descriptions you submit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>System Use:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Device type, app version, crash/error logs</li>
<li>Basic sync information (if you connect Dropbox or another storage provider)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect sensitive identifiers, advertising IDs, or precise real-world location.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use information to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Curate & Publish:</strong> Mythologise discoveries into the Treasury for others to visit.</li>
<li><strong>Teach Methods:</strong> Provide citizens guides, categories, and search to learn how the Republic charts and judges discoveries.</li>
<li><strong>Power Features:</strong> Filters like “largest tameable creatures” or “best paradise systems” require coordinates, stats, and metadata.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Things Working:</strong> Debugging, preventing spam, restoring corrupted entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>We <strong>never sell your data, never profile you for ads</strong>, and never use it outside the context of the Republic.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Public vs. Private Contributions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public:</strong> If you submit discoveries to the Treasury, they may be published with your chosen discoverer name. These entries become part of the Republic’s historical record.</li>
<li><strong>Private:</strong> If you only use the app to sync or store your own notes/coordinates, those remain private unless you explicitly publish them.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>4. The Role of Citizens</h2>
<p>By joining the Republic, you are not merely a user — you become a <strong>citizen explorer</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may keep your own hidden stash, private and unseen.</li>
<li>You may share openly, adding to the growing vault.</li>
<li>You may learn from curated examples, replicating the Republic’s methods to find new treasures of your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vault thrives because citizens contribute. Each shared discovery strengthens the mythos and gives future explorers routes to follow.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Sharing & Services</h2>
<p>We may share data only in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With consent:</strong> Publishing your discovery.</li>
<li><strong>With service providers:</strong> Dropbox or other storage hosts, solely to sync your data.</li>
<li><strong>With law or necessity:</strong> If required to prevent fraud, abuse, or harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>We never sell or rent data.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>We treat your submissions with the same care we treat our own archives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encrypted transfer, secure storage</li>
<li>Limited access, routine backup and audits</li>
<li>Transparency if a breach were ever to occur</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>7. Retention</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private stash:</strong> Kept until you delete it or disconnect storage.</li>
<li><strong>Published entries:</strong> Retained as part of the permanent record of the Republic. You may request removal of your name or attribution, but the discovery itself may be kept to preserve navigational integrity.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>8. Children</h2>
<p>The Treasury is meant for ages <strong>13+</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from younger explorers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access, export, or delete your data.</li>
<li>Disconnect Dropbox or other sync providers.</li>
<li>Request anonymisation of your published name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact us (see §12) to exercise these rights.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Third-Party Realities</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>No Man’s Sky / Hello Games:</em> All in-game content, seeds, and imagery belong to Hello Games. The Treasury is a fan-made project, independent of Hello Games.</li>
<li><em>Dropbox (or other sync):</em> If you connect a sync service, their policies apply alongside ours.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>11. Community Standards</h2>
<p>The Republic is a civil and mythic space. By contributing, you agree to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid hateful or harassing submissions.</li>
<li>Submit only discoveries that are safe for work.</li>
<li>Respect the integrity of the vault.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may moderate or remove entries to protect the canon of the Treasury.</p>
<hr>
<h2>12. Contact the Republic</h2>
<p>Questions, requests, or rights issues:</p>
<p><strong>Office of the Prime Minister — The Republic</strong><br>
Website: <strong><a href="https://wendellsdiary.com">https://wendellsdiary.com</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>If this policy changes, we will update the date and, where material, announce the change through the Treasury app and website.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Closing Oath</h3>
<p>The Republic Treasury exists to <strong>preserve the best of the universe, forever</strong>. It is a vault that grows as explorers join, contribute, and share. We safeguard your data as carefully as we safeguard the mythos, so that together we may continue to discover, colonise, tame, and treasure the infinite.</p>
<p><strong>By the Prime Minister of The Republic</strong></p>
