Technology has always fascinated me, not just for what it can do today but for the possibilities it opens up for the future. One of the most exciting prospects I’m preparing for is the creation of a digital twin—a video-based, AI-driven version of myself that can reflect my thoughts, ideas, and personality.<div><br></div><div>While the technology isn’t quite there yet, I’ve been laying the groundwork for when it is. My blog is already a repository of my ideas and philosophies, and I’ve started envisioning how these can form the basis for a digital twin that evolves alongside me.</div><div><br></div><div>The First Steps: A Chatbot for Ideas</div><div><br></div><div>Initially, I want the digital twin to be a simple chatbot that indexes my blog posts. It would allow people to interact with it by asking questions about my ideas, philosophies, and reflections. The chatbot would focus on presenting my most current thoughts, prioritizing recent content to reflect how my perspective evolves over time.</div><div><br></div><div>This first version would serve as both a tool for personal brainstorming and an interactive feature for anyone interested in engaging with my work. It wouldn’t just repeat my words—it would help people explore and understand my concepts in meaningful ways.</div><div><br></div><div>Expanding the Vision</div><div><br></div><div>As technology advances, I’d like to take the digital twin further. Eventually, I want it to:</div><div><br></div><div>Integrate my YouTube content: Combining my blog and video work would create a more comprehensive representation of my ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>Develop conversational capabilities: Moving beyond text, I envision a digital twin that can speak in my voice, engaging people in natural conversations.</div><div><br></div><div>Include video representation: The ultimate goal is for the digital twin to become a video of me—an AI-powered, lifelike version capable of talking and expressing my thoughts visually.</div><div><br></div><div>Incorporate my entire body of work: Toward the later stages of my life, I’d want the twin to include all my old content, creating a rich archive of my thoughts and creations.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The ultimate result would be a dynamic video representation of myself, combining my voice, ideas, and personality into an engaging, lifelike experience.</div><div><br></div><div>A Digital Twin’s Growth and Independence</div><div><br></div><div>While I’m alive, I envision the digital twin as static—growing only under my guidance and reflecting my evolving thoughts as I update it. However, once I’m gone, I would want the chatbot to be switched on to grow independently. It could continue to evolve and expand, incorporating new ideas and perspectives based on its interactions and the foundation I’ve built.</div><div><br></div><div>This transition would ensure that the digital twin doesn’t just preserve my work but continues it, adapting to new contexts and reaching future generations in meaningful ways.</div><div><br></div><div>Why a Digital Twin?</div><div><br></div><div>The idea of a digital twin isn’t just about preserving my ideas—it’s about sharing them in a way that’s interactive and accessible. I want it to help others explore philosophy, creativity, and meaning in ways that resonate with them.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s also a deeply personal project. Creating a digital twin feels like an extension of my life’s work, a way to continue the conversation even when I’m no longer around.</div><div><br></div><div>Waiting for the Right Technology</div><div><br></div><div>While I’ve already submitted a feature request to OpenAI for this kind of capability, I know it’s going to take time. The technology to create a chatbot that truly embodies a person’s voice, personality, and visual presence is still evolving. For now, I’m focusing on building the foundation—writing, creating, and refining my content so that when the time comes, the digital twin will have a strong base to work from.</div><div><br></div><div>I see this as a long-term project, one that will grow and adapt as technology does. It’s exciting to think about the possibilities and to know that, in some form, my ideas and philosophies might live on, continuing to spark thought and connection.</div>
