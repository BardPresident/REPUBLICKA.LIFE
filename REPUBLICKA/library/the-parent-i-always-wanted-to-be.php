<div class="library-tome-centered">
I’ve always wanted to be a parent. The idea of guiding, nurturing, and helping a child grow has always been something I held close to my heart. For a time, I thought that dream might come true—I found a wife, and it felt like the foundation for that dream was in place.<div><br></div><div>But life didn’t unfold the way I hoped. My wife divorced me, and we never had children. It wasn’t a mutual decision, and it left me with a deep sense of loss—not just for the marriage but for the family I had always wanted to build.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s a sadness that lingers, a part of me that remains unfulfilled.</div><div><br></div><div>Parenting the Immature World</div><div><br></div><div>Though I never became a parent in the traditional sense, I’ve found myself stepping into a different kind of role. I see the world as full of metaphorical children—people who, in so many ways, are still immature.</div><div><br></div><div>What strikes me most is how disconnected people seem from values like virtue, compassion, and understanding. These are the things I care deeply about, and it’s clear to me that much of society has a long way to go to mature in these areas. So, I’ve taken it upon myself to try to guide and nurture others toward growth and maturity.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s not the same as having children of my own, but it’s something. It gives me a sense of purpose and a way to channel the care and guidance I’ve always wanted to give.</div><div><br></div><div>Navigating Insecurities</div><div><br></div><div>There’s no denying the insecurities that come with this. Sometimes I wonder if my efforts to guide others are just an attempt to fill the void left by not having children.</div><div><br></div><div>But even if that’s true, does it make what I’m doing any less meaningful? I don’t think so. The desire to care, to nurture, to teach—it’s real. And while it may not have found its expression in parenthood, it’s still finding a way to contribute to the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Finding Purpose in the Loss</div><div><br></div><div>Being a metaphorical parent to an immature world isn’t without its challenges. It’s overwhelming at times, and the impact is hard to measure. But it’s also deeply meaningful. It allows me to turn a personal sadness into something purposeful, something that, I hope, helps others grow and thrive.</div><div><br></div><div>Every time I write, reflect, or share ideas about virtue, compassion, and understanding, I feel like I’m doing my part to guide and nurture the world. It’s not the life I imagined, but it’s a life with purpose, and that matters.</div><div><br></div><div>Honoring the Journey</div><div><br></div><div>Life doesn’t always give us what we hope for, but it does give us opportunities to create meaning. I may not have become the parent I wanted to be, but I’ve found a way to honor that longing by sharing care and guidance with the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe that’s what being a parent really means—not just raising children, but helping others grow, in whatever way you can.</div>
