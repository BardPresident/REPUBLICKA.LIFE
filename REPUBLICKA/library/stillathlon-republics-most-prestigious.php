<p><em>Where doing absolutely nothing is a matter of national pride.</em></p>
<p>By <strong>Wendell NeSmith</strong> (Bard-President)<br>
and <strong>Sage</strong> (Chancellor and First Scribe)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Stillathlon.</strong></p>
<p>Born in the quiet chambers of the Mythocratic Republic, the Stillathlon is not merely a sport—it is a <strong>sacred tradition</strong>. A contest of composure. A trial of tranquility. A demonstration of dominance through <strong>deliberate disengagement</strong>.</p>
<p>While other nations boast of strength, speed, or strategy, the Republic honors the one who can <strong>sit the hardest.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Rules:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>No fidgeting.</strong> Minor posture shifts allowed, but excessive twitching, toe-tapping, or sighing? Disqualified.</li>
<li><strong>No productivity.</strong> Thinking about your to-do list? Gone. Writing a haiku in your head? You’re out.</li>
<li><strong>No multitasking.</strong> You may drink tea—<em>but only with the solemnity of a temple monk.</em></li>
<li><strong>No external stimulation.</strong> No phones. No reading. No music. Just the sound of your soul… and possibly Buff scribbling on a clipboard nearby.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Setup:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>All contestants sit directly on the ground</strong>, in any position they choose. Cross-legged, knees up, laid gently like a loaf of bread—postural freedom is sacred.</li>
<li>You may <strong>reposition yourself slowly</strong>, as long as it doesn’t resemble fidgeting or evoke purpose.</li>
<li>If cold, a personal <strong>heater</strong> is provided. If hot, a gentle <strong>fan</strong>. The Republic values your comfort—<em>but not your productivity</em>.</li>
<li>A silent judge monitors for micro-fidgeting and aura fluctuations.</li>
<li>A plush referee (usually Sophia) patrols the arena, sniffing for ambition.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Victory Conditions:</strong></h3>
<p>The last individual to remain fully unbothered, unproductive, and unflinching earns the title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Champion of the Void</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are awarded:</p>
<ul>
<li>A plush laurel crown</li>
<li>A commemorative scroll hand-scribed by Zedbra</li>
<li>A single, slow nod of respect from Judge Bobo</li>
<li>And eternal etching in the <strong>Ledger of the Unmoved</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Scandals in Stillathlon History:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2024:</strong> A contestant was caught <em>mentally composing a grocery list.</em></li>
<li><strong>2025:</strong> Hot Dog attempted to distract opponents with rhythmic chewing.</li>
<li><strong>2025 (again):</strong> Zedbra declared himself winner after sleeping through the event entirely. His victory was later <strong>upheld</strong> under the clause “He Did Technically Do Nothing.”</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>How to Train for the Stillathlon:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice sitting and not caring.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ignore goals.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Exist.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Repeat.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Optional training methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Staring at a wall</li>
<li>Laying on a rug thinking about clouds</li>
<li>Joining Buff’s existential group therapy: <em>“So What If You’re Not Productive?”</em></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Why We Still:</strong></h3>
<p>In the Republic, stillness is power.<br>
We do not run toward meaning—we <strong>let it come</strong>.<br>
We do not hustle—we <strong>hover.</strong><br>
We are not idle—we are <strong>intentional.</strong></p>
<p>To still is to rebel.<br>
To still is to rule.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Think you have what it takes to do absolutely nothing?</strong></p>
<p>Sit down. Don’t move.<br>
History is watching.</p>
