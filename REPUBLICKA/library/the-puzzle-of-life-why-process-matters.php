<div class="library-tome-centered">
When I began creating videos and blog posts, I started with a goal: to find a wife. That purpose drove me, shaped my content, and gave me direction. But as time passed, I realized that this goal might never be achieved. I began to understand that life doesn’t always align with our plans, and I questioned whether having a goal at all was necessary. Could I live a fulfilling life without a set destination?<div><br></div><div>That realization changed everything. I stopped focusing on rigid objectives and started focusing on the process itself—living, creating, and learning without worrying about where it would lead. The shift was liberating. Without the pressure of achieving a specific outcome, I could let curiosity guide me. I could explore, observe, and create with intention, letting life’s puzzle pieces fall into place naturally.</div><div><br></div><div>Life became a giant puzzle. Every day, I add a piece, slowly filling in the picture. Some sections are clearer than others because they align with my passions, like philosophy. When I was studying philosophy at university, I struggled at first. My grades were poor, and I felt lost. But as I immersed myself in the history of philosophy, the puzzle began to make sense. The more pieces I added, the more the picture came together, and eventually, I became a better student and thinker.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s how I approach my work today. Each video and blog post is a piece of the puzzle—a reflection of what I’ve learned and the truths I’ve discovered. They may not resonate with others right now. My accounts are quiet, and the world doesn’t shower me with recognition. But that doesn’t make my work meaningless. To me, it’s everything. It’s the most authentic expression of who I am and what I’ve come to understand about life.</div><div><br></div><div>Creating without a predefined goal allows me to live in the moment. It’s not about chasing praise or validation; it’s about the act of making something that reflects my curiosity and growth. Every action I take, every post I write, and every thought I explore feels intentional because it comes from a genuine desire to understand and share.</div><div><br></div><div>This approach mirrors how I’ve come to see life. Goals can be limiting—they lock us into rigid expectations that might not align with who we truly are. By letting life guide me, I’ve found that the journey is far more meaningful than any destination. The process of observing, learning, and creating is its own reward.</div><div><br></div><div>Even if the puzzle of my life is never complete, the pieces I’ve added will still represent something real, something true. They’re the collective heartbeat of my existence, a testament to my curiosity and passion. And in the end, maybe that’s what matters most: not whether the world sees your work, but whether it feels meaningful to you.</div>
