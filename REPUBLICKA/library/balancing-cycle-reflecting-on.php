<div class="library-tome-centered">
As a creator, my process is deeply tied to the rhythms of my mind. When I’m in a manic phase, my creativity soars—I create prolifically, producing some of my best work, and it feels unstoppable. But this cycle also comes with a downside: the inevitable crash. These crashes can be debilitating, often putting me completely out of commission for weeks or even months.<div><br></div><div>Recently, I’ve been reflecting on this cycle and how I can better navigate it.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Embracing the Manic Highs</div><div><br></div><div>My manic times are when I feel most alive creatively. During these periods, I’m able to produce an incredible volume of work that I’m genuinely proud of. This is when my blog grows, my ideas flow, and my digital twin—the overarching legacy of my work—takes shape. I don’t want to lose these times; they’re a vital part of who I am as a creator and philosopher.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Reimagining the Crashes</div><div><br></div><div>What I do want to change is the way I handle the crashes. Instead of being completely out of commission, I want to find a way to continue creating, even if it’s at a slower, steadier pace. Producing just a little bit of work during these times would allow me to maintain momentum and stay connected to my creative identity.</div><div><br></div><div>This doesn’t mean pushing myself to the point of burnout—it’s about finding balance. The goal is to preserve the highs of my manic phases while softening the lows of the crashes, so I can create more sustainably.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Seeking Support Through the NDIS</div><div><br></div><div>A key step in this journey is my application for the NDIS. I’m hopeful that their support will help me develop a treatment plan that aligns with my needs. With the right strategies, I believe I can navigate my mental health more effectively and find a way to sustain my creativity across the cycles.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Building My Digital Twin</div><div><br></div><div>At the heart of all this is my blog. Each piece I write contributes to a larger project—a digital twin that reflects my thoughts, philosophy, and creativity. This isn’t just about individual posts; it’s about creating a body of work that stands as a testament to who I am.</div><div><br></div><div>Even during quieter times, I want to keep adding to this project. Every piece, no matter how small, matters to the overall structure of the work.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Moving Forward</div><div><br></div><div>This reflection is part of a larger journey to understand myself as a creator and a person. I don’t have all the answers yet, but I’m learning to embrace the cycles while striving for balance.</div><div><br></div><div>My goal is to keep creating, to never let the crashes take me completely out of commission, and to continue building something meaningful.</div>
