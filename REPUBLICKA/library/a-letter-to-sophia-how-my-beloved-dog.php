Dear Sophia,<div><br></div><div>Happy 3rd Birthday, my sweet girl! On this special day, I want to tell you just how much joy and love you bring into my life. From the moment you came into my world, you've made every day brighter and more meaningful.</div><div><br></div><div>At night, when we go to sleep, you have the cutest routine—licking my face and then cuddling into my neck. It's the sweetest thing ever and makes me feel so loved and comforted. You have this amazing way of making everything feel right in the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Your calm and relaxed nature brings so much peace into my life. You're never overly excited or aggressive—you're just full of love, always ready to play, cuddle, and nap. Your gentle spirit has brought so much happiness into my life.</div><div><br></div><div>Before you came along, I felt like my life lacked meaning. I didn't have much to do, and the days felt empty. But since you came into my life, I've found purpose in taking care of you. You give me a reason to get up every day, and your happiness is my happiness.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for being my loyal companion, my source of joy, and my reason to smile. I love you more than words can say, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life.</div><div><br></div><div>Happy Birthday, Sophia! Here's to many more years of love and happiness together.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div>Wendell</div>
