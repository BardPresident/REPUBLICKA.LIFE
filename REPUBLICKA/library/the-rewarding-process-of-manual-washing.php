<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>Washing clothes is a task that everyone has to tackle, but the method and process we use can vary greatly. For most of my life, I've relied on automatic washing machines. From my childhood days at home to my adult life, an automatic washer was always part of my routine—except for the period when I was homeless.<br></div><div><br></div><div>During those difficult times, I had to wash my clothes by hand, often while taking a shower. I'd wash my clothes as I showered, then take them off and wash them thoroughly by hand, squeezing out the water to dry them as best I could. It was a laborious process, but there was something incredibly rewarding about it. Each item cleaned felt like a small victory, a testament to my resilience.</div><div><br></div><div>When I finally got a home, one of the first things I received was an automatic washing machine, donated to me. I didn't have a choice in the washing machine I got, and if I had the choice, I probably would have chosen a portable one, because I don't like big, bulky washing machines. The convenience of the automatic washer was undeniable, and I didn't have to think much about my laundry—it was a set-it-and-forget-it solution.</div><div><br></div><div>However, my automatic washing machine eventually started dying. It was on its last legs, and I knew I had to replace it. Not wanting a big and bulky item, I decided to go with a portable washing machine. At first, I was skeptical. It wasn't automatic, and I had to manually manage the cycles. Washing, rinsing, and spin-drying were now distinct stages that required my attention and effort. Moving the machine to access the drain and tap, using an extension cord for power—it all seemed a bit much.</div><div><br></div><div>But as I spent time learning the ins and outs of my new washer, something shifted. I began to appreciate the process. Understanding each stage and being actively involved made the task more engaging. I could see and feel exactly what the machine was doing, and there was a certain satisfaction in being a part of it.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the most rewarding aspects is that I can control how long each item washes. Instead of having a set time like an automatic machine, I can adjust based on how dirty the clothes are. Each wash is unique because it depends on the specific needs of the items I'm cleaning. This means I don’t have to use long cycles unnecessarily; I can be efficient and thorough based on the situation.</div><div><br></div><div>The clothes came out cleaner than they did with my old, broken automatic washer. Despite the extra steps and effort, the results were worth it. This hands-on approach reminded me of the time I spent washing clothes by hand, and how connected I felt to the process.</div><div><br></div><div>Reflecting on these experiences, I've realized that there's a unique value in doing things manually. While automation offers convenience, it can sometimes detach us from the satisfaction of a job well done. Engaging with the stages of washing—washing, rinsing, and spin-drying—brings a rewarding sense of accomplishment.</div><div><br></div><div>So, whether you're using a high-tech machine or a more manual method, take a moment to appreciate the process. There's beauty in the effort and a reward in understanding and controlling each step. It's a reminder that sometimes, the extra effort we put in can lead to better results and a deeper connection to our daily tasks.</div><div><br></div><div>For more insights and personal stories, visit [wendellsdiary.com](http://wendellsdiary.com).</div>
