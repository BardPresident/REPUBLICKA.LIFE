Dear Ivory,<div><br></div><div>Today, I want to share with you the myth of Athena's birth, a story that echoes in my heart and brings forth thoughts of you. This tale, filled with wonder and awe, begins with Zeus and Metis.</div><div><br></div><div>Zeus, in his relentless pursuit, sought the wisdom and companionship of Metis, the goddess of craft and wisdom. Despite her attempts to evade him by transforming into various forms, Metis was eventually caught by Zeus, and they united. Metis conceived a child, but the prophecy that this child would be greater than its father haunted Zeus. To prevent this, he consumed Metis, who by then had transformed into a fly.</div><div><br></div><div>As time passed, Zeus began to experience excruciating pain in his head, a throbbing agony that grew unbearable. Desperate for relief, he called upon Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths, who split open his head with a mighty axe. From this wound sprang Athena, fully grown and adorned in shining armor, a testament to the wisdom and strength inherited from her mother, Metis.</div><div><br></div><div>In this miraculous birth, Athena emerged as the goddess of wisdom, war, and crafts, embodying the virtues of courage and intelligence. She was born not from the usual means but from the very essence of thought and strategy, symbolizing the power of the mind and the birth of wisdom.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, in many ways, you are my Athena. Just as Athena sprang forth from Zeus's head, you have emerged from my thoughts and dreams, fully formed and ready to face the world with wisdom and grace. You embody the love of wisdom, and like Athena, you are equipped to navigate this life with bravery and particularity.</div><div><br></div><div>You have the strength to take on life's challenges, the courage to stand firm in your beliefs, and the wisdom to make thoughtful decisions. Your every step is guided by a deep understanding and care, qualities that resonate with Athena's essence.</div><div><br></div><div>As I think about our journey, I see many parallels to this myth. Just as Zeus sought wisdom and found it in Metis, I have sought purpose and found it in you. The pain and struggle that Zeus endured, leading to the birth of Athena, mirrors the trials I face in my quest to find you, my Ivory.</div><div><br></div><div>From the throbbing pains of doubt and uncertainty, something beautiful and powerful is born—a relationship grounded in wisdom and love. Just as Athena was a beacon of light and wisdom, you are my guiding star, illuminating the path ahead with your presence.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, as you take on this life, know that you carry the strength and wisdom of Athena within you. Be brave, be thoughtful, and embrace every challenge with the confidence that you are equipped to conquer it. Our story, much like the myths of old, is filled with trials and triumphs, but it is also a story of love and resilience.</div><div><br></div><div>You are my muse, my Athena, and together we will write a tale that stands the test of time. Take on this life with the armor of wisdom and the heart of a warrior, knowing that you are cherished and admired.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
