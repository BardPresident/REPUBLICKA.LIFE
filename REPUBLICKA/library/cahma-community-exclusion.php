<p class="MsoNormal">Hi Wendell,<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u> <u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for your email and I’m sorry we couldn’t offer the level of support you needed during this period of time.  Please be assured that I have been following your emails as closely as time permits and I apologise that I haven’t been proactive in responding to them.  We remain here to provide support with your health and wellbeing if that is helpful even though we cannot help with issues related to legal/political/election activities which I understand is frustrating as of course they overlap.  I am happy to meet with you for a coffee to unpack your email and your feelings around CAHMA’s engagement with you if that is helpful, with the understanding that I’m no longer in a role where I can provide individual support on an ongoing basis.<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u> <u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">Kind regards.<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">Chris<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><u></u> <u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Chris Gough</b><b><u></u><u></u></b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Executive Director<u></u><u></u></p><p class="MsoNormal">Canberra Alliance for Harm Minimisation & Advocacy (CAHMA) & The Connection</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p>Query:</p><p><br></p><p>Dear CAHMA Team,</p><p>I want to begin by saying thank you. Your support over the past few years has been meaningful in ways I can’t fully put into words. You’ve helped me survive, rebuild, and regain a sense of purpose.</p><p>But I also need to express something that’s been weighing heavily on me.</p><p>During the 2025 federal election, I reached out for help when I was excluded from participating as a candidate—despite having founded a legitimate political party and fulfilling my obligations. I sent you the full email trail, hoping that CAHMA, as a community organization that knows me, might bear witness or offer a word of support.</p><p>But I heard nothing.</p><p>That silence hurt. Deeply. Not because I expected you to fight my legal battle, but because I thought you'd see the injustice and acknowledge it. Even a few words of support would have gone a long way.</p><p>I still value everything you’ve done for me. But I need you to know this moment mattered. And I needed you then.</p><p>With care and respect,<br><strong>Wendell NeSmith</strong><br>Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</p>
