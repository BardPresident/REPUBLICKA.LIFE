<div class="library-tome-centered">
Spending time in a psychiatric ward was one of the most challenging periods of my life. The environment was unsettling, with the chaos of unstable individuals around me. However, what made it particularly difficult was the treatment I received from the doctors and staff. Despite my attempts to communicate, the doctors didn’t listen to me, leaving me feeling powerless as they medicated and observed me without valuing my input.<div><br></div><div>The staff seemed to follow the doctors’ orders blindly, making the entire experience feel like a system where I had no voice or control. One specific incident that stands out was being denied access to the Internet. I believe the Internet is a human right, essential for staying connected and informed. Being cut off from emails, messages, and online research added to the sense of isolation and frustration.</div><div><br></div><div>I wish the care and environment had been different. Allowing smoking, for example, would have significantly reduced stress for patients who smoke. Additionally, being placed with others who had severe mental issues negatively affected my own mental health. It wasn’t a healthy environment for healing, as the collective distress amplified my own struggles.</div><div><br></div><div>Reflecting on these experiences, I see a need for substantial improvements in the mental health care system. Allowing designated smoking areas and enhancing patient autonomy by considering their input could lead to more supportive and effective care. It's crucial to balance safety with respect for personal freedoms and provide a more individualized approach to treatment.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite my negative experiences, I hold hope for the future. I’m committed to working towards positive changes in mental health care, aiming for a system that genuinely supports healing and respects the dignity of patients.</div><div><br></div><div>To anyone who might find themselves in a psychiatric facility, my advice is clear: you don't want to stay there longer than necessary. Follow the rules, and focus on getting out as quickly as possible because true healing often begins outside the confines of such environments.</div>
