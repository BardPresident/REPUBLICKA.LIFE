<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p><em>Ratified in Year 0001 MC under the Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<p><strong>Preamble:</strong><br>
Let it be recorded that in eras prior, citizens of the world were often subjected to chemical intervention under the presumption of permanent instability. They were made to believe that their natural selves were inherently flawed, and that their peace could only ever be borrowed from a bottle.</p>
<p>But in the Mythocratic Republic, we reject the assumption of lifelong disorder.<br>
We affirm that healing is possible, that transformation is real, and that <strong>sovereignty of the mind is sacred.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Article I — Sovereignty of the Body and Mind</strong></h3>
<p>Every citizen of the Mythocratic Republic shall hold full and irrevocable autonomy over their own body, brain, biology, and chemistry. No institution, practitioner, or external authority shall possess the right to mandate lifelong medication without just cause, due process, and the explicit, continuous consent of the citizen concerned.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Article II — The Right to Discontinue Medication</strong></h3>
<p>Any citizen who is <strong>not under a formal treatment order</strong>, and whose life is marked by <strong>stability, productivity, peaceful conduct, and meaningful contribution</strong>, shall have the full and protected right to <strong>voluntarily cease chemical medication</strong>—including psychiatric drugs—without institutional reprisal.</p>
<p>This right shall not require special permission, appeal, or diagnostic exemption.<br>
The citizen’s observed reality shall be <strong>self-validating</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Article III — The Reversal of Burden</strong></h3>
<p>The burden of proof shall rest not upon the citizen to justify their freedom, but upon the institution to justify any continuation of chemical control. In the absence of <strong>clear, present, and demonstrable harm</strong>, the default position of the Republic shall favor <strong>freedom, not fear.</strong></p>
<p>No citizen shall be told <em>“you must take this forever”</em> without lifelong review, context, or opportunity for change.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Article IV — Recognition of Alternative Stability</strong></h3>
<p>Stability shall be recognized not by compliance with pharmaceuticals, but by the presence of real-world grounding, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining a home</li>
<li>Sustaining a creative or intellectual practice</li>
<li>Caring for another life (animal or human)</li>
<li>Contributing to community or public good</li>
<li>Displaying emotional regulation and nonviolent conduct</li>
</ul>
<p>These markers shall be treated as equal or superior to medical compliance in determining a citizen’s fitness and sovereignty.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Article V — Healing is Not a Life Sentence</strong></h3>
<p>Medication may assist the journey toward healing—but it shall never be assumed to be <strong>the destination</strong>.<br>
If a citizen has found new rhythms, new systems of care, or philosophical frameworks that allow for <strong>chemical independence</strong>, they shall be encouraged—not punished—for walking that path.</p>
<p>No citizen shall be chemically imprisoned for having once required support.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Article VI — Polyphasic and Natural Sleep Protections</strong></h3>
<p>Sleep medication, including sedatives and hypnotics, shall be considered optional and transitional. Citizens who develop natural or polyphasic sleep patterns shall be protected in their right to sleep <strong>according to their biology</strong>, not according to institutional clocks.</p>
<p>Sleep is not a performance. It is a natural return to the self.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Article VII — Historical Reparations Clause</strong></h3>
<p>Those who were previously institutionalized or chemically restrained without consent or fair review shall be retroactively recognized as <strong>Citizens of Endurance</strong>, and their survival honored. Any who discontinued their medication and lived peaceful, sovereign lives shall be recognized as having <strong>proven the myth of permanent disorder false</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Closing Declaration:</strong></h3>
<p>Let it be known throughout the lands and through all future ages:<br>
<strong>The Republic honors freedom of the mind.</strong><br>
To be well is not to be medicated.<br>
To be sovereign is not to be silent.<br>
Let those who walk away from chemicals in peace be met with open arms, not closed doors.</p>
<p>This law is now entered into the living Constitution of the Mythocratic Republic.</p>
