<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>Everyone says they want a superpower.</p>
<p>They dream of flying.<br>
Of teleporting.<br>
Of reading minds.<br>
Of bending reality to their will.</p>
<p>But when a real superpower appears —<br>
quiet, patient, hidden beneath the surface —<br>
<strong>no one wants it.</strong></p>
<p>Because the real superpower doesn’t come with flashing lights or easy rewards.<br>
It comes with patience, responsibility, and the heavy weight of seeing clearly.</p>
<p>And most people are not ready for that.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Real Superpower</h2>
<p>The real superpower is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The ability to see reality before it arrives.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To predict the collapse before the building even shakes.<br>
To sense the flood before the clouds even gather.<br>
To build structures for needs that others cannot even imagine yet.</p>
<p>Not because you control the future.<br>
Not because you guess better than others.</p>
<p>But because you <strong>aligned yourself with the blueprint of emergence.</strong><br>
You built your life according to the deep currents that govern how reality unfolds.<br>
You learned how the structure of change works — and you walk alongside it.</p>
<p>You don’t need magic.</p>
<p><strong>You have clarity.</strong></p>
<p>And clarity is more powerful than any superpower humanity has ever dreamed of.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why No One Wants It (Yet)</h2>
<p>Real superpowers don’t make you a king overnight.<br>
They don’t give you applause.<br>
They don’t bend people to your will.</p>
<p>They give you <strong>lonely vision.</strong></p>
<p>You will:</p>
<ul>
<li>See the cracks before anyone else.</li>
<li>Warn others who laugh or ignore you.</li>
<li>Watch collapses that could have been avoided.</li>
<li>Feel the ache of knowing it didn’t have to be this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will build the bridges early.<br>
You will raise the warning flags early.<br>
You will plant the seeds of renewal before the soil even looks fertile.</p>
<p>And almost no one will notice —<br>
<strong>until the collapse comes, and they realize too late what you were offering.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why this power is so rare:<br>
Because it demands <strong>patience</strong>, <strong>courage</strong>, and <strong>faith</strong> without recognition.</p>
<p>It asks you to walk years ahead of everyone else,<br>
carrying a torch they won’t even realize they need until their lights go out.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why I Still Offer It</h2>
<p>Even knowing all this, I still offer the blueprint.</p>
<p>I still build.<br>
I still write.<br>
I still create the structures that the future will need.</p>
<p>Not because the crowd demands it.<br>
But because <strong>reality demands it.</strong></p>
<p>I know that one day — maybe far from now —<br>
someone will discover the scaffolding I left behind.<br>
And they will walk further than I could.</p>
<p>Not because I was a god.<br>
But because I was patient enough to see clearly when others were not ready.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Real Superpowers Require Real Responsibility</h2>
<p>If you want to fly, jump.<br>
If you want to teleport, dream.<br>
If you want to change the world for real —<br>
<strong>learn how to walk with reality.</strong></p>
<p>That’s the superpower that matters.</p>
<p>And when you master it,<br>
you won’t need magic.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to predict the future,<br>
shape the future,<br>
build for the future —<br>
<strong>because you finally understood how the future grows.</strong></p>
<p>Quietly.<br>
Steadily.<br>
Relentlessly.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Real power isn’t given.<br>
Real power is grown.</em></p>
