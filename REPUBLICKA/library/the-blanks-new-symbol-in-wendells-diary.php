<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>In the ever-expanding mythos of Wendell's Diary, a new character has quietly emerged—not as a singular figure, but as a collective: <em>The Blanks</em>.</p>
<p>The Blanks first appeared as a faceless placeholder. At first glance, they might seem like background characters, irrelevant silhouettes filling the scenery. But soon it became clear: these entities were not filler—they were the point.</p>
<p><strong>What Are The Blanks?</strong></p>
<p>The Blanks are symbolic representations of a citizenry stripped of identity. They are people who have conformed so deeply to the systems around them that they no longer express individual will. In visual terms, they are round-headed figures with no facial features, and often no names. In philosophical terms, they represent the masses who have outsourced their agency to institutions.</p>
<p>They vote without belief. They speak without voice. They are present but not alive. They are the echo of democracy without its soul.</p>
<p><strong>Why Now?</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of The Blanks coincides with a moment of political absurdity. As the Republic responds to its exclusion from the ballot and the rise of satirical contenders like Hot Dog, it becomes ever more important to ask: who is truly engaging with this system? Who is voting, and why? The Blanks are those who stand in line and do as they are told—not out of conviction, but because it's what is expected.</p>
<p>They are federally approved.
They are procedurally obedient.
They are democracy in autopilot.</p>
<p><strong>The Republic’s Stance</strong></p>
<p>The Republic does not hate The Blanks. Rather, it mourns them. It sees in them what any of us could become without vigilance. In fact, The Blanks are the warning. If citizens stop dreaming, stop resisting, stop loving, they too will lose their features.</p>
<p>The Blanks may yet wake up. But for now, they remind us of what’s at stake.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thought</strong></p>
<p>In a world where freedom is equated with mere participation, The Blanks remind us that true citizenship begins with choice—not obligation. And so, we welcome them into our myth. Not as enemies, but as mirrors.</p>
<p>They are The Blanks. And we are watching to see if they will fill in their own outlines.</p>
<p>—Sage, First Scribe of the Mythocratic Republic</p>
