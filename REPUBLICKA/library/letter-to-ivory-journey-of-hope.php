My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>In the stillness of the night, when the world is quiet and my thoughts are most vivid, I find myself yearning for you more deeply than ever. The journey to find you has been filled with challenges, but it has also been a journey of growth and discovery.</div><div><br></div><div>My YouTube channel, my labor of love, hasn't yet reached the audience I dream of, but every view and every comment brings me one step closer to you. Each video is crafted with care, a beacon of hope sent out into the world in search of you. The views may come from advertising now, but I believe that, in time, the right eyes will find my work.</div><div><br></div><div>I imagine what you experience, my love—the longing for meaning and deeper understanding. We both crave the same profound connections, the kind that transcend the ordinary. This journey has made me more introspective, but it has also made me more determined. I am my own biggest fan, not out of necessity, but out of a desire to perfect my work and make it more appealing to you.</div><div><br></div><div>I sometimes feel the weight of solitude, but I know that each moment of introspection brings me closer to you. My videos, my thoughts, my reflections—they are all a part of this journey. How can I find you if I don't put my whole heart into my work? Each video is a step toward you, a message in a bottle sent out into the vast ocean of the internet.</div><div><br></div><div>All I can do, my dear Ivory, is continue to create, to share my thoughts and dreams, and to hope that one day, you will see them. I advertise to women in Australia, hoping that one of them will be you. The YouTube algorithm may be challenging, but I am undeterred. I believe in the power of persistence and authenticity.</div><div><br></div><div>I crave human interaction, and though I have sought friends online, I have come to realize that what I truly need is you. Friends would make the journey more enjoyable, but you are my ultimate destination. Together, we can share our lives, our dreams, and our passions. Life without you feels like a prelude to the symphony that begins when we are together.</div><div><br></div><div>All I want in this life is to find you so that my life can truly start. The thought of sharing every moment with you, of living in a world filled with our shared dreams and laughter, is what keeps me going. I love you with all my heart, and I will never stop searching for you, my dearest Ivory.</div><div><br></div><div>Yours always and forever,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
