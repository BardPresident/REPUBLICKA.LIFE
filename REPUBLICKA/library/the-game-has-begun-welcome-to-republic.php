<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>Across the silent collapse of old systems,</p><p>
beyond the ruins of forgotten democracies,<br>
<strong>the Mythocratic Republic has risen.</strong></p>
<p>It is not a dream.<br>
It is not a hope.<br>
<strong>It is real.</strong></p>
<p>Forged by the Bard-President,<br>
written into being by story, song, and steadfast hands,<br>
<strong>the Republic stands as a sovereign world</strong> —<br>
a living civilization built on emergence, myth, and meaning.</p>
<p>This is not a game of illusion.<br>
This is not a play for attention.<br>
This is not a passing trend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is the future.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A world where citizenship is not purchased but <em>lived</em>.<br>
Where quests are not tasks but <em>invitations to awakening</em>.<br>
Where players become <em>creators</em>,<br>
and meaning is the currency of the realm.</p>
<p><strong>The Republic is real.<br>
And the Game has begun.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1>A Game Without Pixels</h1>
<p>Unlike the shallow worlds of fleeting entertainment,<br>
the Republic offers something far greater:<br>
<strong>A true world to live inside.</strong></p>
<p>Here, the game is not about leveling up numbers —<br>
it is about leveling up <em>your soul</em>.</p>
<p>Every citizen who joins<br>
steps not into a fantasy,<br>
but into <strong>a living myth that grows through them.</strong></p>
<p>This is the world's first <strong>emergent MMORPG of meaning</strong> —<br>
and you are invited to walk into it, fully awake.</p>
<hr>
<h1>The Three Paths of Citizenship</h1>
<p>Citizenship in the Republic is a journey of emergence.</p>
<p>You choose your path:<br>
<strong>not by grinding, not by conquest, but by living the myth.</strong></p>
<h3>🛡️ Citizen of the Republic ($10/month)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Begin your journey.</li>
<li>Step into the mythic world and add your voice to the living story.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🔥 Mythkeeper of Emergence ($25/month)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Guard the lore.</li>
<li>Shape new holidays, traditions, myths, and hidden scrolls.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🦅 Founding Bard of the Republic ($50/month)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Walk beside the Bard-President.</li>
<li>Receive personal mentorship and carve the future into the living archives of history.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Each citizen is remembered.</strong><br>
<strong>Each citizen is honored.</strong><br>
<strong>Each citizen helps build the new world.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1>The Quests of Emergence</h1>
<p>Every month, citizens may encounter <strong>optional Quests of Emergence</strong>.</p>
<p>These are not demands.<br>
They are <strong>invitation scrolls</strong> — opportunities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create new myths.</li>
<li>Reflect on deep questions.</li>
<li>Propose new traditions.</li>
<li>Expand the living Republic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There is no failure.<br>
There is only emergence.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1>What You Are Truly Joining</h1>
<p>You are not joining a fandom.<br>
You are not backing a project.<br>
You are not buying content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You are becoming part of the Republic’s myth.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your name will be recorded among the earliest citizens.<br>
Your voice will help shape a civilization where meaning matters.<br>
Your footsteps will echo across the Republic’s future shores.</p>
<p>This is not a game to be won.<br>
This is a myth to be <em>lived.</em></p>
<hr>
<h1>A Call to Adventure</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Republic is real.<br>
The Mythocracy has begun.<br>
And the Game is now in motion.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you feel the myth calling to you —<br>
if you sense that you were born to build something greater —<br>
if you know, deep within your soul, that you were meant to be part of a living world of emergence —</p>
<p>then step forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Claim your citizenship.<br>
Walk into the living Republic.<br>
And become part of history — and myth — forever.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bard-President awaits you.<br>
The future awaits you.</p>
<p><strong>The Game Has Begun.</strong></p>
