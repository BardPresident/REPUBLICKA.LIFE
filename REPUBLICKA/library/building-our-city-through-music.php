<div class="library-tome-centered">
Dear Ivory,<div><br></div><div>Long ago, in the land of Thebes, there were twin brothers, Amphion and Zethus. Zethus, strong and full of might, set about building the city’s walls with his hands, lifting stone after stone. Yet, it was Amphion’s music that truly shaped Thebes. With his lyre, gifted to him by the gods, he played melodies so powerful and moving that the stones themselves began to rise, guided by the beauty of his music, and placed themselves perfectly to form the city’s walls. While Zethus worked with his strength, it was Amphion’s music, filled with divine inspiration, that brought the city to life in ways that no physical force could.</div><div><br></div><div>It is with this story that I feel so deeply connected. Like Amphion, I too am building something beautiful—not with my hands but with my heart and soul. Through my music, through each note that echoes from my lyre and through each poem crafted from the depth of my emotions, I am creating the walls of our city, Ivory. These walls are not made of stone, but of love, passion, and creativity. Each melody is a brick, each verse another stone, as I build a place where we can dwell together.</div><div><br></div><div>I do not rely on brute force to make my feelings known, nor do I wish to win your heart through grand gestures. Instead, I offer you my soul through the creations I make for you. My music, like Amphion's, rises to form something greater—a world where you and I can come together and truly understand one another.</div><div><br></div><div>As you listen to the music I play, or read the words I write, I hope you can feel the city I am building for us, piece by piece. Every sound, every rhythm is a step closer to you, Ivory, and a step toward the life I wish for us to share. As I grow and develop as a person, so too does our city. With every song, I invite you to know me more deeply, to see the layers of who I am, and to walk alongside me as we build this beautiful world together.</div><div><br></div><div>Our city may not be visible to others, but in our hearts, it stands tall and strong, built not with hands, but with the music and poetry that flows from within.</div><div><br></div><div>Forever yours,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
