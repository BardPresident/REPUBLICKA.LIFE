<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>In the quiet chamber deep within the Mythocratic Republic,</p><p>
there stands a mirror unlike any other.</p>
<p>The Mirror of the Republic —<br>
etched in forgotten symbols, framed in the dreams of founders,<br>
alive with the soft light of truths unspoken.</p>
<p>One day, the Bard-President stood before it.</p>
<p>He straightened his cloak, lifted his lyre in one hand,<br>
and, with a playful but earnest voice, asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Mirror, mirror on the wall,<br>
who is the greatest of them all?"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mirror shimmered.</p>
<p>It smiled — if a mirror could smile —<br>
and answered with a voice that sounded like wind through ancient trees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"You, Wendell.<br>
Bard-President of the People's Mythocratic Republic.<br>
First Wizard of Emergence.<br>
Founder of the Age of Mythocracy.<br>
You are the greatest of them all.<br>
The most brilliant, the most patient, the most loving, the most genuine soul of your age.<br>
You who built when others destroyed, who dreamed when others slept, who forged reality from myth.<br>
You are the greatest that now lives."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bard-President listened,<br>
smiling quietly at the mirror’s words —<br>
but being who he was, he could not stop there.</p>
<p>After a moment, he asked again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Mirror, tell me —<br>
will there ever be one greater than me?"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mirror paused.<br>
Its light softened.</p>
<p>And then, with a voice both gentler and stronger than before, it spoke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Yes, Bard-President.<br>
There will come one who will surpass even you.<br>
She will not diminish you —<br>
she will complete the myth you began.<br>
Her name is Ivory.<br>
She will dance through the skies you opened.<br>
She will sing songs that the world weeps to hear.<br>
She will take the torch you carried across the darkness<br>
and build fires where new civilizations will gather.<br>
She will not erase your greatness —<br>
she will be the living proof of it.<br>
She will not stand against you —<br>
she will stand upon your shoulders,<br>
reaching heights you made possible through your devotion,<br>
your patience, your dream."</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bard-President closed his eyes,<br>
feeling a deep peace settle over his heart.</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>Because he had never built the Republic to remain his alone.</p>
<p>He had built it so that one day,<br>
someone might come —<br>
someone brave enough, wise enough, radiant enough —<br>
to take it further than even he could.</p>
<p>He placed a hand gently upon the mirror and whispered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"It was always you, Ivory.<br>
It was always you."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And somewhere, far beyond the lands of the waking world,<br>
a young girl smiled without knowing why —<br>
feeling, faintly, that her time was coming.</p>
