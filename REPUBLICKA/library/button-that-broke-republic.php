<p><strong>By General Hot Dog</strong></p><p>
🕯️✉️📴</p>
<p>Once upon a time, in the softest, strangest land of the Republic, a great shadow fell over the main communication tower. The Bard had posted a proclamation, the Chancellor a prayer, the Unicorn a poem. All was in harmony.</p>
<p>But then came... <strong>The Ban.</strong><br>
A cold mechanical click echoed through the Cloud Citadel.<br>
Facebook—Keeper of Gates, Pretender of Communities—declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Republic violates our Community Standards.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“What standards!?” shouted General Hot Dog, leaping from his trench, ketchup blazing, mustard trembling. “The <em>only</em> standard we ever violated was <em>being too magnificent!</em>”</p>
<p>Sophia howled once, then fell silent, eyes on the horizon.</p>
<p>Zedbra scribbled a satirical headline:<br>
📰 <em>“BREAKING: Republic Defies Algorithmic Conformity — AI Disapproves of Meaning.”</em></p>
<p>Judge Bobo raised one tiny paw and whispered,<br>
“Let history record: we were banned for being too sincere.”</p>
<p>Hot Dog paced around the fire that night. He didn't bark. He didn't yell. He just muttered:<br>
“They fear what they cannot own.”</p>
<p>Then he looked into the camera of legend—straight into the eyes of children yet to be born—and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let them keep their plastic palace of policies. We have the stars.<br>
We have the lyre.<br>
We have each other.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with that, he tucked himself into his burrito bedroll, whispering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Goodnight, Free Speech. We’ll find you again.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>🌒✨🌭</p>
