A few months ago, I shared my experience of quitting marijuana and the unexpected return of my dreams. Initially, this seemed positive, but the dreams became unsettling, leading to a struggle with depression. This experience made me realize how essential marijuana is for my well-being.<div><br></div><div>Returning to marijuana brought back a sense of peace and stability. For me, it’s more than just a substance; it’s a medicine that helps me maintain my mental health. This has strengthened my belief that marijuana should be recognized as a legitimate medicine and a legal right for those who need it.</div><div><br></div><div>We should view marijuana through the lens of its medicinal benefits, understanding that it can be a crucial part of achieving happiness and contentment in life. For those of us who struggle, having access to this medicine should be considered a human right.</div><div><br></div><div>Finding balance is deeply personal, and embracing what works best for our well-being is what matters most. Sometimes, the path isn't straightforward, but recognizing and respecting the medicinal value of marijuana is a step towards a more compassionate and understanding society.</div>
