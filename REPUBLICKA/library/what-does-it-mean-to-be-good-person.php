<div class="library-tome-centered">
The question of whether we are good people is one that many of us wrestle with, especially those who strive to contribute meaningfully to society. For me, it’s a question I return to often, not because the answer is simple, but because it’s deeply tied to how I live, create, and grow.<div><br></div><div>Being a good person, at its core, might be as simple as contributing positively to our social environment. But even that definition brings complexity. What if my vision of good conflicts with someone else’s? How do I know my actions are truly helping and not inadvertently causing harm? These questions don’t have easy answers, but they drive me to reflect, adapt, and try to align my actions with both my values and the greater good.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Tension Between the Individual and Society</div><div><br></div><div>Navigating the balance between individual needs and societal benefit is one of the biggest challenges. Sometimes I create work that benefits both me and society, and those moments feel deeply rewarding. Other times, I’ve created work that only benefited society, but at my own expense, and it left me feeling depleted.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s become clear to me that compromises are essential. There will be times when we have to prioritize our well-being and other times when the focus is on others. But when our actions benefit both ourselves and society, it’s like hitting an ethical sweet spot—it feels right, purposeful, and aligned.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Learning Through Creation</div><div><br></div><div>For me, creating is not just about making something for others; it’s a way of teaching myself. Whether it’s a blog post, a piece of music, or a video, the process helps me refine my understanding of the world and my place in it. Each piece of work becomes a stepping stone, helping me grow while also sharing something that might inspire or educate others.</div><div><br></div><div>But it’s not always easy. I’ve faced setbacks, moments of doubt, and times when I’ve had to step away to recharge. In those moments, it’s hard not to feel guilty, like I’m letting myself or society down. Yet every time, I come back to creating, because it’s not just work—it’s a way of life.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Ethics as a Lifelong Journey</div><div><br></div><div>To be a good person, you have to be willing to put in the effort. Ethics isn’t just about knowing what’s right or wrong—it’s about constantly asking, “What are my responsibilities?” The answer isn’t universal; it’s deeply personal. It requires humility, the ability to admit when you’re wrong, and a commitment to refining yourself, just as I’ve had to refine my work and my understanding over time.</div><div><br></div><div>If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that being a good person is not about perfection. It’s about striving to do better, learning from mistakes, and recognizing that growth is a lifelong process.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Welcome to the World of Ethics</div><div><br></div><div>To anyone else grappling with these questions, I say this: welcome to the world of ethics. If you want to be a good person, you’re going to have to work hard at it. There’s always room for improvement, and that’s okay—it’s part of the journey.</div><div><br></div><div>Your responsibility is to figure out how your unique gifts can contribute to the greater good. But remember, being a good person isn’t about sacrificing yourself entirely. It’s about finding the balance between benefiting yourself and benefiting society, and recognizing that every step you take toward growth is a step toward goodness.</div>
