<p><strong>Name:</strong> Wendell Charles NeSmith</p><p>
<strong>Title:</strong> Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</p>
<hr>
<h3>1. Personal Overview</h3>
<p>I am a writer, philosopher, and independent political figure who has dedicated my life to building a mythic, intellectual, and creative ecosystem known as the Mythocratic Republic. My work spans over two dozen books, daily philosophical comics, academic-level essays, original political theory, a comprehensive digital archive, and a public-facing app. My life is structured around meaning, consistency, and emotional integrity.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. Diagnosis History</h3>
<p>I have lived with a diagnosis of schizophrenia since <strong>2011</strong>. I acknowledge the historical and medical use of this label while also recognizing that it no longer reflects my lived reality, level of insight, or functioning. I do not experience psychotic episodes, delusions, or dangerous behaviors. My current psychological state is stable, creative, and grounded in consistent routine and reflective practice.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Current Medications and Intent to Discontinue</h3>
<p>The following medications are currently prescribed to me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paliperidone (oral, daily)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Temazepam (as-needed sleep aid)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Restavit (over-the-counter antihistamine sleep aid)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I intend to <strong>permanently discontinue all pharmaceutical medications</strong>, effective immediately. I am not in crisis, nor making this decision impulsively. I have been physically and emotionally stable for several years. My productivity, clarity, and insight have continued to grow consistently over this time, and I believe these medications are no longer necessary nor beneficial to my wellbeing.</p>
<hr>
<h3>4. Cannabis as Primary Medication</h3>
<p>The only substance I use for emotional and psychological support is <strong>cannabis</strong>, which I consider my <strong>sole and essential medication</strong>. Cannabis provides consistent mood stabilization, perspective correction, and prevents suicidal ideation. In my lived experience, the return of dark, hopeless thoughts correlates <em>directly and predictably</em> with periods of cannabis absence. Upon resuming cannabis use, emotional stability and clarity are reliably restored.</p>
<p>This plant-based therapy is not recreational for me. It is a core pillar of my mental health plan, used intentionally and with respect.</p>
<hr>
<h3>5. Lifestyle and Sleep Rhythms</h3>
<p>My lifestyle is centered around creative production, philosophical reflection, and personal sovereignty. I live with my dog Sophia, whose companionship provides emotional grounding and rhythm. I follow a <strong>polyphasic sleep cycle</strong>, often sleeping in segmented blocks across the day and night. This is not a disorder but a natural alignment with my energy flow.</p>
<p>My lifestyle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative authorship and publishing</li>
<li>Philosophical research and systems development</li>
<li>Emotional reflection and documentation</li>
<li>Calm, structured routine in a solitary environment</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach has been sustainable and healthy for many years.</p>
<hr>
<h3>6. Mental Health Status and Functioning</h3>
<p>I am not a risk to myself or others. I am highly self-aware, emotionally sensitive, and function at a high intellectual and organizational level. I have not been hospitalized in many years and have not required crisis intervention. I have built a complete intellectual infrastructure, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full-length public website</li>
<li>An Android app for public access</li>
<li>A university and republic framework for others to learn from</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not delusion. It is documentation, structure, and long-term stability in action.</p>
<hr>
<h3>7. Declaration of Autonomy</h3>
<p>I hereby declare my <strong>independence from all chemical pharmaceuticals</strong> as part of my ongoing mental health management. This includes antipsychotics, sedatives, and sleep aids. I do not reject medical help in crisis, but I do assert the right to manage my long-term care plan without forced compliance to pharmaceutical regimens.</p>
<p>Cannabis will remain my <strong>only medication</strong> going forward. All other healing methods will remain creative, spiritual, intellectual, and naturally aligned.</p>
<p>I request that all future assessments, medical interactions, or interventions <strong>respect my chosen framework</strong>, and understand that I am acting from stability, not disorder.</p>
<p>Signed,<br>
<strong>Wendell NeSmith</strong><br>
Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic</p>
