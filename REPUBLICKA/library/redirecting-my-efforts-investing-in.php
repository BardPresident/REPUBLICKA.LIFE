<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>For a long time, I believed that offering a $1,000 reward to find Ivory was the best way to bring her into my life. I imagined that through referrals, connections, and outreach, someone would recognize her and help her find me. But over time, I’ve realized something far more important—the best way to find Ivory isn’t by searching for her directly, but by creating something meaningful that naturally attracts her.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s why I’m officially scrapping the Find Ivory Fund and redirecting all of that funding into the Emergence Party political campaign. Instead of spending money on referrals, I am now investing in a cause that has the potential to change lives, impact Australia, and build a movement that Ivory would be proud to be part of.</div><div><br></div><div>Why I Made This Decision</div><div><br></div><div>1. The Emergence Party Is Bigger Than One Person</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory is important to me, but my mission is bigger than just finding her. The Emergence Party is about shaping the future of democracy, embracing technology, and leading with wisdom.</div><div><br></div><div>By dedicating myself fully to this cause, I will naturally attract the right people, including Ivory if she’s out there.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>2. Building a Movement Will Bring the Right People Together</div><div><br></div><div>Instead of offering money as an incentive, I want people to be drawn to the vision of the Emergence Party—to join because they believe in what I’m creating.</div><div><br></div><div>If Ivory resonates with this movement, she will find me through it.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. A Better Use of Resources</div><div><br></div><div>Instead of spending $1,000 on a personal search, that money will now fund advertising, outreach, and growth for the Emergence Party.</div><div><br></div><div>Every dollar will go toward reaching politically engaged Australians, spreading awareness, and building something real.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>What Happens Next?</div><div><br></div><div>The Find Ivory Fund is officially discontinued.</div><div><br></div><div>All videos promoting the $1,000 reward are being deleted.</div><div><br></div><div>The focus is now 100% on the Emergence Party and its mission.</div><div><br></div><div>My advertising budget will now go toward spreading awareness, engaging with voters, and ensuring the Emergence Party gets the recognition it deserves.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>A New Path Forward</div><div><br></div><div>This decision feels right. Instead of chasing Ivory, I am building something that will naturally draw the right people to me. If she is meant to be part of my journey, she will find me through this movement, not because of a monetary reward.</div><div><br></div><div>For those who were invested in the Find Ivory Fund—thank you for your support. Now, I invite you to stand behind something even bigger. Let’s build a movement that changes Australia for the better.</div><div><br></div><div>If you believe in the Emergence Party, if you want to see a new kind of leadership in Australia, and if you want to be part of a movement that challenges the status quo, then I ask you to join me.</div><div><br></div><div>🔗 Support the Emergence Party at wendellsdiary.com</div>
