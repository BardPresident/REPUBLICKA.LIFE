<div>YouTube is a powerful platform for creative expression, and if your child is an up-and-coming star, it can be an exciting opportunity for them to share their talent with the world.

This guide will help you and your child make the most of their YouTube journey.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Step 1: Start with a Parent-Managed Account</div><div><br></div><div>If your child is under 13, they cannot legally own their own YouTube account due to COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). Instead:</div><div><br></div><div>Create the account in your name as the parent and manage it fully.</div><div><br></div><div>Use this account to upload your child’s videos, monitor comments, and interact with the audience.</div><div><br></div><div>Clearly state in the channel description that you manage the account for your child.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Step 2: Set Up a Workflow for Creating and Uploading</div><div><br></div><div>Collaboration is key when working with a young creator:</div><div><br></div><div>Content Creation: Encourage your child to take the lead in creating videos.

Here’s how to prepare:</div><div><br></div><div>Gradual Independence: Slowly transition responsibilities, such as uploading and interacting with the audience, to your child.</div><div><br></div><div>Education: Teach them about copyright rules, community guidelines, and handling online feedback.</div><div><br></div><div>Shared Management: Stay involved as a collaborator or advisor, even if they take primary control.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Step 5: Managing Monetization</div><div><br></div><div>If your child’s channel grows to the point of earning money:</div><div><br></div><div>AdSense Account: A parent must manage the AdSense account until your child turns 18. Earnings will go through your account but can be allocated for your child’s use.</div><div><br></div><div>Transparency: Keep open communication about how the earnings will be used, whether for savings, reinvestment in their channel, or fun activities.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Step 6: Promote Online Safety</div><div><br></div><div>Teach your child how to handle potential challenges, including:</div><div><br></div><div>Privacy Protection: Avoid sharing personal details like addresses, schools, or locations.</div><div><br></div><div>Dealing with Harassment: Discuss how to report and block inappropriate users or comments.</div><div><br></div><div>Staying Positive: Help them develop resilience to negative feedback and focus on their passion for creating.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Step 7: Plan for the Future</div><div><br></div><div>As your child grows, their interests and goals may evolve:</div><div><br></div><div>Career Exploration: Use their YouTube journey as a way to develop skills in video editing, marketing, and public speaking.</div><div><br></div><div>Channel Ownership: At 18, they can fully take over the account, including AdSense management and all creative decisions.</div><div><br></div><div>Legacy Building: Encourage them to see their channel as more than just a hobby—it’s a portfolio of their creativity and hard work.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Key Takeaways for Parents</div><div><br></div><div>Be Supportive: Nurture your child’s talent by being an active part of their YouTube journey.</div><div><br></div><div>Stay Involved: Balance independence with oversight to ensure safety and compliance.</div><div><br></div><div>Foster Growth: Help your child learn the skills and values that come with being a responsible content creator.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>By following this guide, you can support your child in navigating the exciting world of YouTube while ensuring their safety and fostering their growth. With the right structure and collaboration, you can help them shine both online and in life.</div>
