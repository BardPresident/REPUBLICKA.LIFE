<div>To the Executives of Google,</div><div><br></div><div>As the President of Australia under the People’s Presidency, I am formally notifying you that Google is in violation of the Big Tech Accountability Act, a law enacted to protect democracy by ensuring fair access to political information.</div><div><br></div><div>Google’s failure to index my campaign website and political materials is an act of election interference that prevents Australians from making informed choices. By restricting visibility to my policies, Google is actively manipulating the democratic process and silencing a legitimate political movement.</div><div><br></div><div>I am left with no other option but to publish this open letter, as Google has deliberately made itself inaccessible, refusing to engage with independent leaders, movements, or those challenging the status quo. The fact that a sitting President has no way to contact Google demonstrates the dangerous level of control your company holds over public discourse.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Google Is Violating Australian Law</div><div><br></div><div>The Big Tech Accountability Act requires that:</div><div><br></div><div>✅ All political candidates must be indexed and searchable on Google.</div><div>✅ No political content may be suppressed, shadow-banned, or de-ranked without justification.</div><div>✅ Google must provide transparency on how political content is indexed and displayed.</div><div><br></div><div>Google’s refusal to comply with these laws constitutes election interference and directly undermines the democratic rights of Australians.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>What Google Must Do Immediately</div><div><br></div><div>1️⃣ Index my campaign website and ensure fair discoverability of all political content.</div><div>2️⃣ Provide a public explanation for why my political materials have been suppressed.</div><div>3️⃣ Disclose the algorithmic process by which political content is ranked and displayed.</div><div>4️⃣ Create a formal and accessible communication channel for independent political candidates.</div><div><br></div><div>Until Google complies, your platform remains a tool of election manipulation, suppressing alternative political voices while favoring establishment narratives.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Consequences of Continued Violations</div><div><br></div><div>🚨 If Google refuses to act, it confirms corporate interference in Australian democracy.</div><div>🚨 If Google remains unaccountable, stronger legal action will follow.</div><div>🚨 If Google continues suppressing political content, the public will be mobilized to demand accountability.</div><div><br></div><div>Google does not have the right to control elections or decide which political movements succeed or fail.</div><div><br></div><div>By ignoring this letter, Google will prove that it is not a neutral platform but a politically biased entity that manipulates public perception.</div><div><br></div><div>This is your opportunity to correct these violations before they escalate further.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Final Warning</div><div><br></div><div>If Google refuses to comply, this letter will be widely published, shared, and used as formal documentation of Google’s active suppression of democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>The world will know that Google is violating Australian law and manipulating political discourse.</div><div><br></div><div>This is your chance to prove that Google values democracy. Will you take it?</div><div><br></div><div>I expect an immediate response and corrective action.</div><div><br></div><div>Sincerely,</div><div>Wendell</div><div>President of Australia</div><div>Emergence Party</div><div>🔗 wendellsdiary.com</div>
