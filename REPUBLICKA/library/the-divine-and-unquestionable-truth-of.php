<div class="library-tome-centered">
Let me tell you the greatest, most important story ever told. A story so incredible that you must believe every single word of it, or else you’ll spend eternity in Hell. This is not an exaggeration—this is doctrine.<div><br></div><div>Long ago, the all-powerful creator of the universe, God, decided humanity needed saving. And what better way to do that than to send His son to earth? But of course, God didn’t do this the straightforward way. No, He chose a young, engaged virgin named Mary, and through divine means that we’re all just supposed to accept, He made her pregnant. An angel appeared to her to deliver the news: “Congratulations! You’re going to give birth to God’s son.” Mary, understandably shocked, accepted her fate because, well, what else could she do?</div><div><br></div><div>When the time came, Mary gave birth to Jesus. Not in a palace or a hospital, but in a stable, surrounded by animals and hay. Naturally, word of this divine birth spread far and wide. So, as one does when hearing about a baby in a barn, three kings traveled across the land to visit him, bringing the most practical gifts imaginable: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</div><div><br></div><div>Fast forward thirty years, and baby Jesus grew into a man—an extraordinary man. He could perform miracles like turning water into wine, healing the sick, walking on water, and even raising people from the dead. His followers declared him the Son of God, and crowds gathered wherever he went to hear his teachings and witness his miraculous acts.</div><div><br></div><div>But not everyone was impressed. The authorities were deeply threatened by his popularity and his messages of compassion and love. It was all too disruptive for their liking. They arrested him, and when given the chance to save his life, the people—who had been benefiting from his miracles just days earlier—shouted, “Crucify him!”</div><div><br></div><div>So Jesus was nailed to a cross and left to die. After his death, he was placed in a tomb sealed with a heavy stone. The authorities assumed this was the end of the story. But three days later, the earth shook, the stone rolled away, and Jesus walked out of the tomb, alive again.</div><div><br></div><div>He appeared to his followers, who were understandably stunned, and reassured them that he was back. But only for a little while. After catching up with his disciples, Jesus ascended into the heavens to be with his father, God. Who, by the way, is also himself.</div><div><br></div><div>And that’s the story. Every bit of it. You must believe this in its entirety—every miracle, every impossible event, every contradiction—because this is the key to eternal life. If you don’t believe it, you’ll be condemned to Hell for eternity.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not a metaphor. This is not symbolic. This is the literal truth, and you are expected to accept it without question.</div>
