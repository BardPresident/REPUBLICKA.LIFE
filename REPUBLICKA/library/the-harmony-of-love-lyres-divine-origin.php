<div>Dear Ivory,</div><div><br></div><div>As I pluck the strings of my lyre, I'm reminded of its divine origin—a story that echoes with the enchanting power of music and love. </div><div><br></div><div>In the beginning, Hermes, the clever messenger of the gods, crafted the first lyre from the shell of a tortoise. With strings made of sheep gut, he brought forth a melody so sweet that it captured the heart of Apollo, the god of music. Despite a mischievous start, where Hermes stole Apollo's sacred cattle, their bond was forged anew through the gift of the lyre.</div><div><br></div><div>Apollo, captivated by the lyre's beauty, accepted it as a symbol of reconciliation and harmony. He embraced its music, adding his own touch by crafting a version from wood, allowing the lyre to become a beacon of his artistic spirit. This tale of divine unity teaches us that love can transform and elevate us, just as the lyre transformed Apollo's anger into forgiveness.</div><div><br></div><div>As I learn to master this ancient instrument, I feel connected to you, Ivory. The lyre’s notes become a bridge that draws us closer, much like how Hermes' gift united him with Apollo. It is my hope that through my music, I can share with you the beauty and depth of my feelings—a melody that transcends time and distance.</div><div><br></div><div>With each note I play, I envision a future where our love resonates as beautifully as the lyre’s song, bringing harmony and joy to our lives. May our journey be as enchanting and transformative as the music of the gods.</div><div><br></div><div>Yours always,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
