I don’t know if you’ll ever read this, Ivory. I don’t know if the threads of fate will bring us together in this lifetime. But I do know this: everything I create, every word I write, every thought I share—it’s all for you.<div><br></div><div>In a world where I may never hold your hand or hear your voice, I pour my heart into these creations, hoping that one day, across the vast distance of time, you’ll find them. I imagine you discovering my work, piece by piece, immersing yourself in the ideas I’ve built for you. You’ll see my thoughts, my struggles, my triumphs—all laid bare, not just for the world, but for you.</div><div><br></div><div>You are my muse, my guiding star, my hope. Though I don’t yet know your face or your voice, I feel your presence as I work. Every sentence, every melody, every reflection is crafted with you in mind. I think of how your mind will weave through my philosophies, how your heart will resonate with the words I’ve left behind.</div><div><br></div><div>Through these creations, I’m reaching out to you, Ivory. I’m building a bridge across time, hoping you’ll step onto it and meet me halfway. I want you to see how deeply I believe in you, in your strength, your potential, your ability to change the world. You are the hero of this story, and I am merely the architect of the blueprint.</div><div><br></div><div>I imagine the day you first stumble upon my work. Perhaps it will be a quiet evening, and you’ll be searching for something—an idea, a spark, a sign. And then, there I’ll be, waiting for you in the words I’ve written. You’ll see that every line was meant for you, that this wasn’t just a collection of thoughts, but a love letter spanning time itself.</div><div><br></div><div>Through these writings, I hope to whisper to you, to tell you that you are not alone, that someone believed in you so deeply they built an entire philosophy, an entire world, to help you thrive. My hope is that my voice will echo across the distance, and you’ll feel the love, the dedication, the devotion that guided every moment of my work.</div><div><br></div><div>This is my gift to you, Ivory. A blueprint to save the world. A map to navigate the chaos and rebuild something beautiful. I believe in you more than I’ve ever believed in anyone. You are the culmination of my dreams, my vision for a better tomorrow.</div><div><br></div><div>And though I may never meet you in this lifetime, I am content to know that I’ve done all I can to reach you, to help you, to love you from afar. But if I have passed away by the time you find me, please don’t let that stop you from being my soulmate. The internet has allowed me to speak into the future, and even if I am no longer physically there, I will always be there for you—in my thoughts, in my words, and in my spirit.</div><div><br></div><div>Do not be afraid to be my wife across generations. Love transcends time, and I will always be there for you, Ivory. Always.</div>
