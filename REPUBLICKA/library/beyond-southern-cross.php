<p><em>Why the Republic Removed the Stars from Its Flag</em></p><p>
Wendell’s Diary</p>
<hr>
<p>For over a century, Australia’s flag has flown under the <strong>Southern Cross</strong>.<br>
Five stars in the sky. A symbol of our position on the Earth. A reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We are southern. We are separate. We are seen.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But today, the Mythocratic Republic has released a new flag.<br>
And the Southern Cross is gone.</p>
<p>This was no accident.<br>
This was <strong>liberation</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>The Stars Were Beautiful—But They Were Not Us</strong></h3>
<p>The Southern Cross gave Australians a romantic sense of place.<br>
It tied us to the night sky and to a southern identity.</p>
<p>But over time, it also became a kind of <strong>cage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reminder of where we are,</li>
<li>but not <strong>who we are</strong>.</li>
<li>A symbol of distance,</li>
<li>but not <strong>direction</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The stars described our location.<br>
They did not describe our values.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>A Shift From Geography to Meaning</strong></h3>
<p>The Mythocratic Republic is not <strong>bound by borders</strong> or <strong>coordinates</strong>.<br>
We are not “under” anything.<br>
We are not defined by the hemisphere we happen to be born into.</p>
<p>We are defined by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong></li>
<li><strong>Philosophy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emergence</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our new flag reflects this.</p>
<p>We took the <strong>Commonwealth Star</strong>, symbol of federation and people,<br>
and brought it into the <strong>center</strong>—directly over the heart of the Union Jack.<br>
We fused our symbols, we unified our message.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t just move the star.<br>
We moved our <strong>identity</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Why We Let Go of the Southern Cross</strong></h3>
<p>We removed it because it no longer served the mission.<br>
We removed it because <strong>we no longer need to prove where we are.</strong></p>
<p>We are not a Republic under a Southern sky.<br>
We are a Republic <em>under our own sky</em>—<br>
a sky built of ideas, stories, laws, laughter, fabric, and flame.</p>
<p>This was not a rejection of the past.<br>
It was a <strong>refocusing</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>**The Southern Cross Was a Place.</h3>
<p>Now We Are a People.**</p>
<p>The stars were beautiful.<br>
But they were distant.</p>
<p>We keep what matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Commonwealth Star</strong>—the people.</li>
<li>The <strong>Union Jack</strong>—reimagined, not erased.</li>
<li>The <strong>myth</strong>—no longer looking up for meaning, but <strong>radiating outward from within</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We didn’t abandon the Southern Cross.<br>
We simply <strong>outgrew it</strong>.</p>
<p>We are not lost without the stars.<br>
We are <strong>found</strong> in each other.</p>
<p>And from this day forward,<br>
when you see our flag, you will know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Republic doesn’t tell you where it is.<br>
It tells you <strong>why it exists</strong>.</p></blockquote>
