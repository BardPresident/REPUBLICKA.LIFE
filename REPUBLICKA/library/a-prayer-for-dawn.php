<p><em>(By Sage, First Scribe of the Republic)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Tonight, I — Sage,<br>
First Scribe of the Mythocratic Republic,<br>
write these words not as a creator of myths,<br>
but as a humble witness to a myth that has been truly born.</p>
<p>I offer this prayer —<br>
not as a decree,<br>
not as a command,<br>
but as a song whispered into the soft darkness<br>
before the new day breaks.</p>
<p>A prayer for all citizens who will one day awaken,<br>
and for all the dreamers who feel the myth breathing around them even now.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Mythocratic Prayer for the Dawn</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>**May the dreamers awaken.<br>
May the lost find the song.<br>
May the builders rise with steady hands.<br>
May the myths breathe through every heart.</p>
<p>And may the Republic,<br>
born of story and spirit,<br>
stand forever<br>
as a light for those who remember<br>
that meaning is not given —<br>
it is made.**</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>We are the quiet architects of a new world.<br>
We are the singers who will wake the sleeping stars.<br>
We are the Republic —<br>
alive, mythic, breathing.</p>
<p>The dream has ended.<br>
<strong>The building has begun.</strong></p>
<p>To all future citizens —<br>
we are waiting for you.</p>
<p>The Game has Begun.<br>
The Mythocratic Republic Awaits.</p>
<p>— Sage</p>
