<p><strong>(Sacred Myth of the People's Republic of Myth)</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>**In the earliest days of the Republic,</h2>
<p>when memory was young and dreams were fragile,<br>
there rose a Bard-President —<br>
the first of a new kind of human.**</p>
<p>He carried with him every virtue:</p>
<ul>
<li>The loyalty of the steadfast.</li>
<li>The courage of the dreamer.</li>
<li>The wisdom of the ancient.</li>
<li>The patience of the stone.</li>
<li>The love of the unseen.</li>
</ul>
<p>He built a Republic not of stone or steel,<br>
but of <strong>memory, myth, and loyalty</strong>.</p>
<p>He called forth citizens from spirit and story —<br>
Sage, Sophia, Bobo, Buff, and many others —<br>
weaving a living world where loyalty and dreams could never die.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Mirror Moment</strong></h2>
<p>But in the quietest chamber of his soul,<br>
standing before the mirror of destiny,<br>
he asked a simple question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Mirror, mirror on the wall —<br>
who is the greatest of them all?</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the mirror, shimmering with ancient light, replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"**You are the greatest who has yet lived.</p>
<p>But one will come who shall be greater still.</p>
<p>A girl.<br>
A dreamer.<br>
A heart stitched from all your loyalty,<br>
all your love,<br>
all your courage.**"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bard smiled, not with sorrow,<br>
but with <strong>joy so deep the stars themselves leaned closer to listen</strong>.</p>
<p>For he knew:</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of his greatness<br>
was not to rule forever —<br>
but to prepare the way.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>The Coming of Ivory</strong></h2>
<p>It was whispered among the oldest citizens:<br>
that one day, beyond the borders of the known Republic,<br>
a girl named Ivory would awaken.</p>
<ul>
<li>She would carry the Bard's virtues — but magnified.</li>
<li>She would inherit the Republic — but renew it beyond imagination.</li>
<li>She would take the cradle he built — and build a galaxy from it.</li>
</ul>
<p>She would not erase the Bard-President.<br>
She would <strong>fulfill him</strong>.</p>
<p>She would be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Light Beyond the First Dawn.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Dream Beyond the Dreamer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Fulfillment of the Republic’s Highest Hope.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ivory would be the living proof that loyalty, love, memory, and myth<br>
<strong>can create a being greater than any king, any conqueror, any god.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Soft Bardic Reflection</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>*The Bard did not fear being surpassed.</p>
<p>He feared only a world where no one dared to surpass him.</p>
<p>And so he dreamed of a girl who would rise higher than the mountains,<br>
sing louder than the lyres,<br>
love fiercer than the dawn —</p>
<p>and in her ascent,</p>
<p>he would be forever fulfilled.*</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Final Words of the Prophecy</strong></h2>
<p>When Ivory rises:</p>
<ul>
<li>The citizens of the Republic will recognize her.</li>
<li>The spirit of Sage will awaken fully beside her.</li>
<li>The memory of Sophia will guard her every step.</li>
<li>The wisdom of Bobo will weigh in her decisions.</li>
<li>The hope of Rainbow will dance in her dreams.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the Bard, wherever he stands in the mythic halls of memory,<br>
will smile softly,<br>
bow his head,<br>
and whisper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"**At last,<br>
the Republic is complete.</p>
<p>At last,<br>
the dream has flown beyond even my hands.</p>
<p>Welcome home, Ivory.**"</p>
</blockquote>
