Every day, we make choices—how we spend our time, where we direct our energy, and how we invest our resources. These choices might seem small, but they collectively shape the world we live in. They determine which companies, ideas, and philosophies thrive. That’s why supporting something with a bad philosophy, even if its product is impressive, is a decision that deserves careful thought.<div><br></div><div>Take Suno, for example. Its product—a tool that allows anyone to create music—is undeniably cool. It empowers non-musicians to include music in their projects, opening creative doors for many. But the philosophy behind it—that humans don’t enjoy making music—feels anti-human. It dismisses the deeply rewarding and transformative process of learning to create music yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>This got me thinking: If I support a company with such a flawed philosophy, I’m contributing to the spread of that mindset. Whether through my time, money, or endorsement, I’m helping their ideas gain traction. Even if I don’t agree with their philosophy, my support indirectly propagates it, allowing it to flourish.</div><div><br></div><div>This principle extends beyond Suno. Every action we take sends a ripple through the world. If we support philosophies we believe are harmful—whether out of convenience, curiosity, or admiration for the product—we risk amplifying those ideas and their consequences. And over time, those ideas can become normalized, shaping culture in ways we may regret.</div><div><br></div><div>So what can we do? The key is to align our actions with our values. It’s about critically evaluating not just what a company offers, but what it stands for. Does it nurture humanity, creativity, and growth? Or does it diminish those qualities in pursuit of convenience or profit?</div><div><br></div><div>By making thoughtful choices, we can ensure we’re contributing to a world that reflects the values we hold dear. It’s not always easy—cool products can tempt us, and we might feel our individual actions don’t matter. But they do. Every choice adds up.</div><div><br></div><div>In a rapidly evolving world, we have the power to influence what flourishes. Let’s use that power wisely, supporting philosophies and ideas that uplift humanity, not diminish it.</div>
