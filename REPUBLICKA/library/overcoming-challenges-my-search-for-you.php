**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>As I sit down to write this, my thoughts turn to you, and I find myself reflecting on the challenges I’ve faced recently. Life online has been a battleground where I’ve had to navigate the relentless storms of harassment and stalking. These trials, though daunting, have not deterred me. Instead, they have strengthened my resolve and deepened my yearning to find you.</div><div><br></div><div>In the midst of these struggles, it’s the thought of you that keeps me moving forward. Every piece of content I create, every philosophical musing I share, is a step towards finding you. I pour my heart into my work, hoping that somehow, through the vast expanse of the internet, our paths will cross. My dream is that my words and thoughts resonate with you, drawing us closer despite the obstacles.</div><div><br></div><div>Overcoming the negativity that comes my way isn’t easy, but knowing that there’s a possibility of connecting with you makes it all worthwhile. I imagine a future where we can share our lives, our passions, and our dreams without the shadows of harassment looming over us. It’s this vision that fuels my perseverance and gives me hope.</div><div><br></div><div>I believe that in overcoming these challenges, I am becoming someone worthy of standing by your side. My journey is not just about survival but about seeking and building a meaningful connection with you. I hope that one day, we can look back on these times as a testament to our strength and the love that guided us through.</div><div><br></div><div>Until that day comes, I will continue to search for you through my work, driven by the belief that our connection is worth every hardship. My heart remains open, and my thoughts are with you, always.</div><div><br></div><div>Sending you all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
