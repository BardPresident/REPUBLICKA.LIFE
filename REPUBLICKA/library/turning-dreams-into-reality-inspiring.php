<div>Sometimes, the dreams we hold closest to our hearts can feel like distant delusions, out of reach and impossible to bring to life. Yet, I believe it is in chasing these dreams—no matter how far-fetched they seem—that we find our purpose and create something truly meaningful. For me, this dream is to watch young people step into the world of philosophy through YouTube and blogging, sharing their raw thoughts, growing in their creativity, and ultimately becoming their best selves.</div><div><br></div><div>When I look at the content landscape today, I see a void. There aren’t many young philosophers with YouTube channels or blogs, and that breaks my heart because I know the potential they hold. Kids are naturally curious, raw, and full of energy. They’re unfiltered, creative, and not yet bound by the composed structures of adulthood. Watching them express their thoughts and explore big ideas would be fascinating—and more than that, I want to see them grow over time. I want to follow their journeys as they evolve, mature, and develop their own philosophies, celebrating their growth every step of the way.</div><div><br></div><div>But here’s the reality: this dream isn’t something I can just sit back and wait for. If I want a world where young people dive into philosophy and share their journeys, I have to help make it happen. I have to inspire them, guide them, and create the conditions for them to see this as a possibility. That’s my goal, and while it’s a lofty one, it’s what drives me.</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine a world where a teenager starts a YouTube channel or blog, nervously sharing their first philosophical musings. Over time, their thoughts deepen, their voice becomes stronger, and their ideas take shape. As an audience, we get to witness not just their creative evolution but also their personal growth. We become part of their journey, and in doing so, we grow alongside them. This isn’t just about kids creating content; it’s about fostering a culture of curiosity, creativity, and intellectual exploration from a young age.</div><div><br></div><div>This is my vision: a world where young creators feel empowered to explore philosophy and share their perspectives. A world where their voices are heard, their journeys are celebrated, and their growth is nurtured. It might seem like a delusion now, but I believe that with effort, patience, and a little bit of inspiration, it can become a reality.</div><div><br></div><div>So, to the young dreamers out there: if you’ve ever felt a spark of curiosity about life’s big questions, don’t hold back. Start sharing your thoughts, no matter how rough or unpolished they seem. Your journey matters, and the world is waiting to hear your voice. Let’s create a space where philosophy isn’t just for the adults—it’s for everyone.</div><div><br></div><div>And to those who dream like me: let’s work together to inspire this change. Because sometimes, turning our dreams into reality is the most philosophical thing we can do.</div>
