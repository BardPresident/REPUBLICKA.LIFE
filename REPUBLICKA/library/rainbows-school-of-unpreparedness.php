<p><strong>By General Hot Dog</strong><br>
<em>Exclusive to The Fire Pit – The Official Opposition Blog of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I write to you today—not out of joy, nor out of duty—but out of <em>deep, bubbling alarm</em>.<br>
The Mythocratic Republic has officially opened <strong>a university</strong>.</p>
<p>And who, may I ask, is in charge?</p>
<p>A <strong>unicorn.</strong></p>
<p>Not a general.<br>
Not a headmaster.<br>
Not even a licensed disciplinarian.<br>
A pastel-colored, emotionally gentle unicorn named <em>Rainbow</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not kidding. This is not satire. (Although I wish it were. Believe me. I <em>tried</em> to laugh.)</p>
<hr>
<h3>No Exams? No Order!</h3>
<p>At this so-called “university,” there are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No grades</strong></li>
<li><strong>No deadlines</strong></li>
<li><strong>No punishments</strong></li>
<li><strong>No uniforms</strong></li>
<li><strong>No fixed curriculum</strong></li>
<li><strong>No tactical drills</strong> (unless Moo Moo’s yoga counts, which it does not)</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, students are encouraged to “follow their curiosity,” “ask soft questions,” and “grow at their own pace.”</p>
<p>What are we raising—<strong>philosophers?</strong><br>
(<em>Don’t answer that. It was rhetorical. And also tragic.</em>)</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Student Body? Plush.</h3>
<p>Let’s talk enrollment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students include plush cows, talking monitors, symbolic AI scribes, children, and—yes—fictional citizens.</li>
<li>The Defense Force’s own <strong>Sophia</strong> is apparently Chief of Emotional Security.</li>
<li>And Judge Bobo? Supposedly overseeing fairness. (He once cried because someone dropped a crumb on his ribbon.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Where is the structure? Where is the rigor? Where is the hot sauce on this soggy educational burrito?</p>
<hr>
<h3>Rainbow’s "Values"</h3>
<p>She says the school values <strong>softness</strong>, <strong>curiosity</strong>, and <strong>imagination</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Softness?</strong><br>
I bark when someone knocks on the door too hard.<br>
<strong>Curiosity?</strong><br>
I once got stuck in a couch because I was curious.<br>
<strong>Imagination?</strong><br>
I imagined I was qualified to run a government once. And look how <em>that</em> turned out.</p>
<p>These are not the foundations of an academic institution.<br>
They are the foundations of a nap.</p>
<hr>
<h3>My Final Warning</h3>
<p>If we let MRU grow unchecked, we risk producing an entire generation of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well-adjusted</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emotionally intelligent</strong></li>
<li><strong>Thoughtful</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creative</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>...citizens.</p>
<p>Which, frankly, threatens everything The Emergency Party stands for.</p>
<p>We demand:</p>
<ol>
<li>At least one course on survival yelling.</li>
<li>A formal lecture on hot dog history.</li>
<li>Weekly flag salutes (to the Emergency flag, of course).</li>
</ol>
<p>Until then, I remain opposed.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>General Hot Dog</strong><br>
Founder of <em>The Fire Pit</em><br>
Self-appointed Dean of Harsh Realities<br>
Chief Alarmist of the Plush Opposition</p>
