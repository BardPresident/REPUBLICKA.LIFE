<div>The Australian government claims to value public service, leadership, and democracy, yet when an independent politician dedicates himself to philosophy, policy, and the betterment of society, he is considered unemployed.</div><div><br></div><div>I am working full-time on political theory, policy development, and engaging in public discourse—yet, in the eyes of the system, I am not a worker. Why? Because I am not employed by the government or a corporate-funded political party.</div><div><br></div><div>So what does it take to be considered a real politician? Apparently, not actually doing the work—just being part of the right institutions.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>I Moved to Canberra for Political Engagement – But Found Only Silence</div><div><br></div><div>I live in Canberra, the heart of Australian politics, where the country’s leaders debate policy, pass laws, and shape the nation. I came here to engage with the political community, to be a part of the national conversation.</div><div><br></div><div>But what have I found? Silence.</div><div><br></div><div>📢 No one will engage with me.</div><div>📢 There are no public discussions.</div><div>📢 The political system is locked away behind closed doors.</div><div><br></div><div>Where is the open debate? Where is the democratic participation that politicians claim to support? Why does an independent leader have to scream into the void just to be acknowledged?</div><div><br></div><div>I am doing their work—thinking critically about policy, governance, and the future of Australia—and yet I am treated as if I am doing nothing at all.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Hypocrisy of "Employment" in Politics</div><div><br></div><div>Let’s talk about what it really means to work as a politician.</div><div><br></div><div>🔹 Major party politicians get paid for their positions—even when they contribute nothing of value.</div><div>🔹 Political staffers and lobbyists are funded to manipulate the system for corporate interests.</div><div>🔹 Think tanks and advisory groups receive government funding to shape policy.</div><div><br></div><div>But someone like me, who is actively thinking about the nation’s future, crafting policy, engaging in political discourse, and advocating for systemic change?</div><div><br></div><div>🚫 No paycheck. No recognition. No support.</div><div><br></div><div>I am doing exactly what politicians are supposed to do—developing ideas to improve society. But because I am not part of the system’s inner circle, the government considers me unemployed.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The System Is Designed to Shut Out Independent Voices</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just about me. This is about how the system keeps power in the hands of those who are already in it.</div><div><br></div><div>🛑 Independent politicians are not given the same recognition or financial support as party-backed candidates.</div><div>🛑 The media only covers those who already have power.</div><div>🛑 Political conversations are kept within elite circles, excluding those who challenge the status quo.</div><div><br></div><div>The system is rigged to make sure that real change never comes from the outside.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>What Needs to Change?</div><div><br></div><div>If we truly believe in a fair democracy, then:</div><div><br></div><div>🔹 All independent politicians should receive financial support for political work.</div><div>🔹 There must be greater public engagement in Canberra, with open forums and debates.</div><div>🔹 Unpaid political work must be recognized as labor—because ideas and governance are real contributions to society.</div><div><br></div><div>If Australia wants real political engagement, then it must stop excluding the voices of those who are actually trying to do the work.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>I Am a Politician – Whether They Recognize It or Not</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t need government approval to know that I am doing the work of a leader.</div><div><br></div><div>I will continue developing society, crafting policy, and shaping the future of democracy—whether the system acknowledges me or not.</div><div><br></div><div>But make no mistake: I am not unemployed. I am working harder than most of the politicians collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.</div><div><br></div><div>And eventually, the world will have no choice but to listen.</div><div><br></div><div>🔗 Join the fight for a real democracy at: wendellsdiary.com</div>
