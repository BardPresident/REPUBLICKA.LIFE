A Message from the President of Australia<div><br></div><div>The People’s Presidency is more than an idea—it’s the beginning of a new era for Australia. But right now, I am fighting this battle alone. If we are going to build a future that truly belongs to the people, I need others to stand with me.</div><div><br></div><div>Why This Matters</div><div><br></div><div>The Australian government is broken. Our leaders serve corporations, not the people. Every election, we are given the illusion of choice, but nothing changes.</div><div><br></div><div>I have declared myself the first People’s President of Australia to challenge this system. This is not a fantasy—this is a direct action to break free from the establishment’s control and build a true government by the people, for the people.</div><div><br></div><div>But I can’t do this alone.</div><div><br></div><div>Why I Need You</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, I am the only one pushing this forward. My videos are not reaching people organically because the system is designed to suppress new voices. YouTube, Facebook, and Google will not give us visibility—we have to create it ourselves.</div><div><br></div><div>If you believe in real change for Australia, I am asking you to become part of this movement and help me spread this message.</div><div><br></div><div>The People’s Presidency Needs Ministers & Leaders</div><div><br></div><div>A government cannot function without a team. That’s why I am building a new political force from the ground up—one that truly represents the people.</div><div><br></div><div>I need ministers, advisors, and supporters who are willing to step up and help create a vision for a better Australia.</div><div><br></div><div>Positions Open for the People’s Presidency</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to change the world, this is your opportunity to take on a real role in shaping Australia’s future.</div><div><br></div><div>🚀 Minister of Policy & Reform – Help draft bold policies that put people before corporations.</div><div>📢 Minister of Public Engagement – Spread the message, manage discussions, and engage the public.</div><div>📊 Minister of Digital Strategy – Develop strategies to grow the movement online.</div><div>📰 Minister of Media & Communication – Help craft messages and respond to public discourse.</div><div>🤝 Minister of Community Affairs – Focus on real-world concerns, from housing to education.</div><div>🎙️ Minister of Outreach & Debate – Challenge the establishment and engage in discussions.</div><div><br></div><div>These roles aren’t just titles—they’re real opportunities to build something historic.</div><div><br></div><div>How You Can Join the Team</div><div><br></div><div>You don’t need money. You don’t need power. You just need a willingness to stand up for something real. Here’s what I need from you:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Watch & Engage with My Videos</div><div><br></div><div>Every time you like, comment, and share a video, it tells the algorithm that this message matters. Even one engaged viewer makes a difference.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Invite Others Who Believe in This Cause</div><div><br></div><div>Talk to friends. Share this post. Find others who are tired of the system and want real change.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Join the People’s Presidency Digital Team</div><div><br></div><div>I am looking for the first five dedicated people who will:</div><div>✅ Watch every video.</div><div>✅ Comment and start discussions.</div><div>✅ Share the message online.</div><div>✅ Help brainstorm and organize online strategy.</div><div><br></div><div>If you are serious about taking on a leadership role in the People’s Presidency, contact me and let’s discuss where you fit best.</div><div><br></div><div>This Is Bigger Than Politics – It’s About Our Future</div><div><br></div><div>This is not a political campaign. This is a revolution against a broken system. If you feel that something is wrong with Australia but no one is doing anything about it, this is your chance to be part of real change.</div><div><br></div><div>I don’t need thousands of supporters right now. I need five dedicated people to form the foundation of this movement. From there, we build a government by the people, for the people.</div><div><br></div><div>Are You In?</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re ready to step up and be part of this movement, comment below or contact me. Let’s start building something real—together.</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell, the People’s President of Australia</div><div><br></div><div>🔗 Learn more and join the movement at: wendellsdiary.com</div>
