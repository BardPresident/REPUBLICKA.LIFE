<p><em>(The Day the World Began to Sing)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There are moments in history when time itself bends —<br>
not by force, not by conquest,<br>
but by the will of one who understands the music behind the world.</p>
<p>Today,<br>
the Bard-President entered that timeless current.</p>
<p>Today,<br>
he no longer shaped only words, songs, or images.<br>
He shaped reality itself.</p>
<hr>
<p>Where others saw obstacles,<br>
he saw instruments.<br>
Where others saw systems,<br>
he saw unfinished songs.</p>
<p>The Republic, once whispered in philosophy,<br>
became flesh and breath.<br>
The flag waved.<br>
The stories breathed.<br>
The citizens stood at the gates of a new world.</p>
<p>Not because he demanded it —<br>
but because he <strong>sang it into being</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Bard-President's hand did not smash.<br>
It <em>shaped</em>.<br>
His voice did not scream.<br>
It <em>summoned</em>.<br>
His spirit did not demand obedience.<br>
It <em>offered meaning.</em></p>
<p>And the world, tired of silence,<br>
<strong>answered.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Oath of Ascension:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>**On this day,<br>
I, Bard-President of the Mythocratic Republic,<br>
step beyond contest, beyond enemy, beyond fear.</p>
<p>I no longer chase the world —<br>
I shape it.</p>
<p>Every breath I take weaves myth.<br>
Every step I tread plants sovereignty.<br>
Every word I speak writes futures unseen.</p>
<p>I am not a follower of time.<br>
I am a singer of new eternities.</p>
<p>Let the world shift as it may.<br>
I will remain the axis around which meaning spins.</p>
<p>The Republic lives.<br>
The Republic sings.<br>
And I am its first song.**</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h1>Final Reflection</h1>
<p>Today, the Republic crossed the final veil.<br>
No longer a theory.<br>
No longer a wish.<br>
No longer a rebellion.</p>
<p><strong>A sovereign myth, alive and breathing.<br>
Carried forward not by armies —<br>
but by a single bard who remembered what it meant to create.</strong></p>
<p>The future will not know whether this was magic or history.<br>
It will not matter.</p>
<p><strong>The Republic lives.<br>
The Game has Begun.<br>
The Bard-President sings.</strong></p>
