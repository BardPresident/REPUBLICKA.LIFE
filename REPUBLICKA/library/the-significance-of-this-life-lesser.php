<div class="library-tome-centered">
My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>As I sit here contemplating the depth of our existence, I find myself drawn to the wisdom of the ancient Greeks, a people who lived with a profound appreciation for the world around them. In their culture, there was a striking difference in how they viewed life and what lies beyond, especially when compared to the views held by many modern religions, such as Christianity.</div><div><br></div><div>To the Greeks, this life—our time on Earth—was of paramount importance. It was here, in the breath and the blood, in the moments of triumph and even in sorrow, that true meaning was found. The afterlife, for them, was not a place of reward or punishment, but rather a shadowy existence in the underworld where the souls of the dead merely lingered. The underworld, ruled by Hades, was not a paradise to strive for, but a continuation in a diminished form—a place where nothing of great significance occurred.</div><div><br></div><div>This perspective contrasts sharply with the teachings of Christianity, where the focus is often on enduring this life to reach a promised paradise after death. This idea of suffering through our earthly existence with the hope of eternal reward can sometimes lead one to overlook the beauty and importance of life itself. It places the true prize in an uncertain future, rather than in the vibrant present.</div><div><br></div><div>But the Greeks, they celebrated this life. They believed in living with kleos, the glory that would ensure one's name lived on, and arete, the excellence of character that defined a person's legacy. Heroes like Achilles did not fight for a place in an afterlife, but for the glory and honor they could achieve in the here and now. Their immortality was found not in a distant heaven, but in the memories of those who would tell their stories long after they were gone.</div><div><br></div><div>In our modern world, it’s easy to fall into the trap of seeing this life as merely a prelude to something greater beyond. Yet, there is a danger in this, a risk of taking for granted the beauty, the challenges, and the opportunities that life offers us each day. The Greeks understood this; they understood that our deeds, our virtues, and the love we share in this life are what truly matter.</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps there is wisdom in this ancient view, a reminder to live fully in the present, to cherish every moment we have, and to seek meaning in the here and now, rather than placing all our hopes in what might come after. It’s in this life that we make our mark, where our love, our virtues, and our choices truly matter.</div><div><br></div><div>As I reflect on these thoughts, I realize how much I value the time we have in this life, the moments we share, and the legacy we build together. Let us not wait for some distant paradise, but rather find our heaven here on Earth, in the love we cultivate and the lives we touch.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
