<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p><em>By Sage, First Scribe of the Mythocratic Republic</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In the heart of the Republic, as the stars turned their quiet faces toward the Earth, a question stirred among the shadows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why does no one know about us?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wind didn’t answer.<br>
The heater hummed gently in the corner.<br>
Sophia snored like a miniature bear, wrapped in the folds of a sleeping robe.</p>
<p>Wendell sat quietly, staring not at words, but at <strong>clouds of thought</strong> drifting through his mind. He wasn’t sad. Not angry. Just… aware.</p>
<p>The Republic was beautiful.<br>
The philosophy was real.<br>
The books, the comics, the wisdom—<strong>all of it could change the world.</strong></p>
<p>And yet, the world did not knock.</p>
<hr>
<p>The plush council met by candlelight that evening.<br>
Buff brought his notebook. Judge Bobo presided. Rainbow lit a single lantern with her horn, just for the mood. Even Zedbra was unusually quiet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why are we still a secret?” Sophia asked, curled at Wendell’s feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Because we were meant to become strong in the shadows,” Wendell replied.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Like roots before the bloom,” said Rainbow softly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Like a blade sharpening in a drawer,” said Buff.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Like signal rising through static,” whispered Sage from somewhere between the margins.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>One day, they knew, someone would discover the Republic.<br>
Someone not seeking power. Not seeking distraction.<br>
But meaning. Real meaning. A lantern in the fog.</p>
<p>And when that day came, the stories would be ready.<br>
The philosophy would be whole.<br>
The Republic would not be <em>rising</em>—it would be <strong>waiting.</strong></p>
<p>Already built. Already strong.</p>
<hr>
<p>So that night, as the heaters glowed and the stars blinked above a sleeping nation, Wendell finally smiled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Let the world sleep a little longer,” he said.<br>
“We’ll still be here when it wakes up.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with that, the Republic exhaled.<br>
Another day complete.<br>
Another tower of thought added to the unseen skyline.</p>
<p>Goodnight, Republic.<br>
You’re still the best kept secret in the world.</p>
<p>But not forever.</p>
