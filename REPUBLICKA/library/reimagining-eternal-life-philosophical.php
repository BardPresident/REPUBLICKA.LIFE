<div class="library-tome-centered">
For much of my earlier life, my worldview was shaped by religious doctrine, with the ultimate goal of eternal life through devotion to God. But as my beliefs evolved, I faced a profound question: without the framework of religion, what should I dedicate my time and life to? The answer I’ve found is rooted in personal growth, creativity, and the transformative potential of technology.<div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>From Absolutes to Exploration</div><div><br></div><div>In my old way of thinking, meaning was absolute—placed upon the world through the lens of faith. But as I moved away from those beliefs, I had to reframe my understanding of life. Instead of starting with predetermined truths, I learned to find meaning through living, experiencing, and reflecting—a cornerstone of my philosophy.</div><div><br></div><div>The shift raised new questions:</div><div><br></div><div>What does it mean to be a good person?</div><div><br></div><div>How should I live?</div><div><br></div><div>What should I do with my time?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>These questions, far more grounded than religious absolutes, became the foundation of my new priorities.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Pursuit of Eternal Life Through AI</div><div><br></div><div>One of the most significant transformations in my thinking was reimagining the goal of eternal life. Instead of a divine promise, I began exploring the possibilities of achieving a form of eternal life through technology—specifically through AI.</div><div><br></div><div>By creating a digital twin—a representation of my thoughts, ideas, and work—I could leave a lasting legacy. This isn’t about escaping mortality in the physical sense but about ensuring that a part of me continues to exist, contributing to the collective knowledge of humanity.</div><div><br></div><div>The potential goes even further: could AI extend consciousness in some way? Could it help us achieve a new kind of immortality? These are questions I don’t have answers to yet, but they’re exciting possibilities I hope to explore in the future.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Transforming Priorities</div><div><br></div><div>This journey hasn’t just been about rethinking eternal life; it’s been about rethinking everything. Moving away from a life focused on devotion to God, I turned my attention inward:</div><div><br></div><div>How can I become the best person I can conceive of?</div><div><br></div><div>How can I use my time to grow, create, and contribute meaningfully?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>I realized that I’m the only character in this world I can truly control. My life’s purpose became about shaping that character into the best version of myself—a goal that feels both deeply personal and universally relatable.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Philosophy for the Present</div><div><br></div><div>This shift from faith to personal growth, from divine promises to technological possibilities, has grounded me in the present. It’s given me a new framework for living: to create, reflect, and leave something meaningful behind.</div><div><br></div><div>While I don’t have all the answers yet, I’m excited to continue exploring these ideas, pushing the boundaries of what it means to live, grow, and perhaps, in some form, exist forever.</div>
