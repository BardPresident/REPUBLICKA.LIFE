<div class="library-tome-centered">
The world we live in today is controlled by a system that prioritizes profit over people, where corporations hold the real power, and politicians dance to their tune. This isn’t a democracy. It’s a system designed to ensure that the wealthy grow wealthier, while the rest of us are left to pick up the scraps. And it’s time to destroy it.<div><br></div><div>At the heart of this broken system lies corporate greed. Corporations, driven by an insatiable hunger for profit, exploit workers, manipulate consumers, and devastate the environment. Their goal isn’t to create value for society—it’s to extract as much as possible, no matter the cost. And the cost is staggering: low wages, inequality, environmental collapse, and the erosion of human dignity.</div><div><br></div><div>But corporate greed doesn’t exist in isolation. It thrives because of political alignment with corporations. Politicians, who are supposed to represent the people, have instead aligned themselves with the interests of big business. Lobbyists ensure that corporate agendas dominate policymaking, bending laws to benefit the few at the expense of the many. Public welfare takes a backseat to corporate profits.</div><div><br></div><div>The economic disparity this system creates is staggering. The rich live in unimaginable luxury, while billions struggle to afford basic necessities. The gap between the wealthy elite and everyone else isn’t just a sign of inequality—it’s a symptom of a system designed to keep people down. The game is rigged, and the rules are written by those at the top.</div><div><br></div><div>The most insidious part of all of this is the lack of public consent. Decisions are made in backrooms, influenced by money and power, with little regard for the people these decisions affect. Corporations dictate the future of our planet and society, but the public is never consulted. We are told this is democracy, but it’s an illusion. True democracy would mean every voice is heard—not just the voices with the deepest pockets.</div><div><br></div><div>This system manipulates us at every turn. Through advertising, political propaganda, and media controlled by corporate interests, it shapes our perceptions and choices. It keeps us distracted, divided, and docile, while those in power continue to exploit the world for their gain.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a system that cannot be reformed. It must be destroyed. The structures that uphold corporate greed and political corruption need to be dismantled, piece by piece, so something better can emerge in their place.</div><div><br></div><div>The Philosophy of Emergence teaches us that true progress comes not from imposing control, but from allowing growth to occur naturally. This system does the opposite: it imposes control and suppresses potential. If we are ever to create a world that values people over profit, we must first destroy the structures that prioritize greed and power.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s time to let go of the idea that this is the best we can do. It’s time to demand something better. But before we can rebuild, we must tear down. And that starts with recognizing the corruption for what it is: a system designed to exploit, control, and silence.</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just about imagining a better future—it’s about ensuring that the system responsible for so much suffering can no longer exist. Because until we destroy it, hope will always remain out of reach.</div>
