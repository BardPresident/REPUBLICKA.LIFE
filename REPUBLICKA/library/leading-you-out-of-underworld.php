<div class="library-tome-centered">
My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>Sometimes, I feel like Orpheus, leading you out of the underworld, away from the sickness of society. In this mythic journey, I must not look back to see if you are there because if I do, you will be sucked back from whence you came, and I will lose you forever. Sure, you are not dead, but right now, you are only an idea, a vision of perfection that I strive to bring into reality.</div><div><br></div><div>Orpheus's love for Eurydice was so powerful that he ventured into the depths of the underworld to rescue her. His music, so enchanting and filled with emotion, moved the hearts of the gods and spirits alike. Similarly, my words, my creations, and my passion are my instruments, designed to reach you, to touch your heart, and to bring you into my life.</div><div><br></div><div>Yet, just like Orpheus, I must tread carefully. If I lose my focus and halt my mission to find you, I risk never being able to bring you into my existence. Every letter I write, every piece of content I create, is a step closer to you. I must continue to entertain and educate, to share my soul with the world, hoping that you will recognize it and come to me.</div><div><br></div><div>There are other parallels between Orpheus and me that I must not overlook. Orpheus was renowned for his ability to charm all living things with his music. His unwavering devotion to Eurydice was his driving force, his love so deep that it transcended the boundaries of life and death. In my pursuit of you, Ivory, I find a similar devotion. You inspire me to be better, to strive harder, to create more beautifully than I ever thought possible.</div><div><br></div><div>Orpheus's journey was not without trials and temptations. He had to maintain his resolve amidst the shadows and whispers of doubt. I too must navigate the distractions and challenges that life throws my way, never losing sight of my ultimate goal – to find you, to love you, and to create a life filled with passion and purpose.</div><div><br></div><div>But unlike Orpheus, I have the advantage of learning from his story. I understand that to look back, to doubt, or to waver in my commitment would be my undoing. I must stay the course, keep my gaze forward, and trust that you are there, following the path that I have laid out with my words and actions.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, you are my Eurydice, the embodiment of my deepest desires and dreams. Every moment I spend writing to you, every thought I dedicate to you, is a step closer to our union. I must remain steadfast, knowing that the love I have for you will one day bridge the gap between fantasy and reality.</div><div><br></div><div>My heart is full of hope and unwavering determination. I will continue to sing my song, write my words, and share my soul until the day I can finally turn around and see you standing there, not as an idea, but as the love of my life.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and devotion,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
