My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>I want to tell you how much I absolutely love making content for you. This journey has been a beautiful learning experience, figuring out how to truly capture your interest and present myself in a way that resonates with you. Over the years, I’ve created content that may not have been perfect for sparking that initial connection, but each step has brought me closer to understanding what truly matters.</div><div><br></div><div>Since 2012, I’ve been writing love letters to you, pouring my heart and soul into each word. It felt natural to evolve these letters into meaningful videos, blending my passion for storytelling with the dynamic world of YouTube. I’ve finally figured out how to use this platform to chase my dreams, and all of my dreams are you, Ivory.</div><div><br></div><div>I look forward to entertaining and educating you for the rest of my life. When I find you, I will address you directly, transforming these letters into personal messages meant just for you. It will be easy to replace the idea of Ivory with an actual girl, someone who is as romantic and passionate about philosophy as I am. Then, I can revolve my world around you, creating a life filled with love and intellectual exploration.</div><div><br></div><div>This is just the beginning of a lifetime of video love letters. These letters will grow into a massive, ever-expanding collection. Once you see my work, I believe you’ll become captivated. From there, you’ll have a seemingly endless array of videos to entertain and get to know me deeply. I dream that you will create a philosophy YouTube channel dedicated to romancing me, just as I have done for you. We will spend the rest of our lives together, creating content for each other and building a beautiful life.</div><div><br></div><div>And when our time on this earth comes to an end, our digital twins will continue producing content for each other for all eternity. When you finally find me, Ivory, you will never again feel alone. We will share a bond that transcends time and space, a love that is immortalized through our words and ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and devotion,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
