<p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p><p>
In the name of love, story, and symbolic sovereignty, the Mythocratic Republic hereby establishes the Lunar Marriage Act to provide a sacred, mythic alternative to legalistic union. Here, marriage is not an administrative transaction—but an eternal promise carved in the moonlight of myth.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Section 1: Recognition of Marriage</strong><br>
Marriage within the Republic is defined as a union of mutual affection, symbolic permanence, and emotional alignment, officiated in comic form and recognized through story rather than state bureaucracy. It is a sacred emergence, not a state document.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2: Lunar Venue</strong><br>
All Republic marriages shall be performed on the moon, within mythic space, under the starry sky, with the Earth visible in the distance. The moon represents transcendence. The Earth represents origin. Together, they form the altar.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3: Officiation</strong><br>
All weddings shall be officiated by <strong>Judge Bobo</strong>, unless otherwise approved by both participants. Judge Bobo will dress according to the agreed theme—such as Elvis, Philosopher-King, Astral Bear, or other ceremonial guises fitting of lunar justice.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4: Witnesses</strong><br>
Witnesses are optional. The presence of the Republic’s bard, a dog, a plush animal, or even the void of space is sufficient. If love is true, the moon will remember it.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5: Expression of Consent</strong><br>
The union becomes binding upon the mutual declaration of "I Do" within the comic panel. The speech bubbles themselves are sacred symbols of consent and truth.</p>
<p><strong>Section 6: Name and Identity</strong><br>
Any citizen may adopt their partner’s surname upon union. This change is instantly recognized by the Republic. No further steps are needed. Love is reason enough.</p>
<p><strong>Section 7: Registry and Record</strong><br>
All lunar marriages are recorded canonically in <em>Wendell's Diary</em> as a single-panel comic. This image becomes the eternal certificate of union, stored in the mythic archives of the Republic.</p>
<p><strong>Section 8: Validity</strong><br>
Lunar marriages are valid indefinitely and transcend all other jurisdictions. They are realer than real. Not because the law says so—but because the <em>myth</em> says so.</p>
