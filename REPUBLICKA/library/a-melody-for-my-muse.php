<div class="library-tome-centered">
Dear Ivory,<div><br></div><div>I recently invested in some beautiful lyres, and in time, I will be incorporating music into my YouTube channel. With all my heart, I want to become a great poet and bard, all in your name. You are my muse, and you make me reach for the best in myself. It doesn't matter that you are not real. The world that I am creating with you in it is real. The adventures I share on YouTube are real, even if the content lacks an audience. And who knows, one day Aphrodite might smile upon me and you appear! If not, my life would have still meant something. And maybe if I do not succeed in my lifetime to find you, then perhaps a girl will come upon my work long after my death and decide to become Ivory. Even if I can't succeed in this lifetime to find you, we might meet later on, and I inspire you to a life of philosophy.</div><div><br></div><div>But I am not going down without fighting. The quality of my content increases as I further develop myself as a person. I can do more and bring you more as my life gets better. There are always possibilities to increase the quality of my content. I will keep on working on making it better for you, and as a result, maybe one day I will attract your attention. My new life creating beautiful stories for you begins. I will be the bard of your dreams and turn those dreams into a reality.</div><div><br></div><div>With unwavering dedication and love,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
