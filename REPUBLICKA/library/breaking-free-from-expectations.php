<div class="library-tome-centered">
When I left my family, the weight of societal expectations hit me like a mountain. Everyone assumed I would jump into full-time work, supporting myself the way most adults are expected to. But for me, that was not only impossible—it felt like a life sentence. The idea of dedicating my life to something menial, day after day, without personal accomplishment, was unbearable. I couldn’t commit to a life that felt hollow, where my contributions were measured only in monetary terms.<div><br></div><div>Instead, I chose a different path, pouring my time and passion into creating videos and writing blog posts. These aren’t just hobbies; they’re deeply fulfilling pursuits where I feel a sense of accomplishment and purpose. Yet, society often dismisses this kind of work. People call it a “hobby” because it doesn’t make money, ignoring the time, effort, and heart I invest. That dismissal hurts, especially when I see how much value I can create—not in dollars, but in ideas, creativity, and connection.</div><div><br></div><div>For me, the ability to pursue this passion comes from being on a pension, which provides stability. Without it, I’d be forced into a job that would strip me of the time and energy to create. But that’s not a luxury most people have. It’s unfair that the freedom to explore one’s passions often depends on having a disability or other specific circumstances. Shouldn’t everyone have the opportunity to live a life driven by passion and fulfillment rather than necessity?</div><div><br></div><div>Universal Basic Income (UBI) could be the answer. In a future where artificial intelligence and advanced automation replace traditional labor, we’ll need to rethink how we value people. We won’t need human labor to sustain the economy, so why should someone’s worth depend on their ability to work? UBI could free people to pursue what truly matters to them, whether it’s art, philosophy, science, or something we haven’t yet imagined.</div><div><br></div><div>I believe this shift could lead us back to our roots in philosophy. If people were free from the daily grind, they’d have time to reflect, question, and explore. At first, many might feel lost without work to anchor their lives. But as they search, they might rediscover the joy of philosophical discourse—sharing ideas and perspectives socially, just as Socrates did in the public square.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s what I try to do with my work. I lead by example, sharing my thoughts and philosophies through videos and blog posts, hoping to inspire others to think for themselves. It’s a modern take on the Kantian public use of reason: helping people develop the tools to question the world and make their own judgments. I know most of my work goes unrecognized, but if even a few people engage with it and change their perspective, I’ve succeeded. The seeds of enlightenment are planted one idea at a time.</div><div><br></div><div>As Gandhi said, “Be the change you want to see in the world.” That’s what I’m doing—living my philosophy and inviting others to do the same. I hope that in the future, society values people for more than just their labor and sees the power of creativity, philosophy, and connection. If we can embrace these ideas, we might finally achieve a true enlightenment where independent thought thrives and human potential is unbound.</div>
