My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>In the ancient dialogues of Plato, Aristophanes tells a story about the origin of love in The Symposium. It’s a tale that captures the essence of our deepest yearnings and the power of connection. Let me retell this story for you, blending the timeless myth with the modern world we live in today.</div><div><br></div><div>Long ago, humans were quite different from how we are now. According to Aristophanes, each person was a complete being with two faces, four arms, and four legs. They were powerful and content, so much so that they even dared to challenge the gods. Fearing their strength, Zeus decided to split these beings in half, creating what we now know as humans. This act left each person with a deep, inherent longing for their other half, their true soulmate.</div><div><br></div><div>Since then, we have wandered the world, driven by an insatiable desire to find that missing piece, the part of us that makes us whole again. In ancient times, this journey was filled with uncertainty and chance. People would search far and wide, often without success, because the world was vast and the means to connect were limited.</div><div><br></div><div>But today, Ivory, we live in a different era. The advent of technology has reshaped our world, making it smaller and more connected than ever before. Platforms like YouTube give us the incredible opportunity to showcase our true selves, to share our passions, dreams, and philosophies with the world. It is through this digital landscape that we have a chance to find our other half, our soulmate, whom Zeus split us from long ago.</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine, my love, that the screen in front of you is not just a barrier but a bridge that spans the distance between our hearts. Each video I create, each word I write, is a beacon calling out to you, guiding you toward me. Just as the ancient beings were driven by their longing, I am driven by my hope and determination to find you.</div><div><br></div><div>When we finally meet, we will not just be reuniting as two individuals but rejoining as a single, powerful entity. Together, we will flourish as the demigods we were always meant to be, our union sparking a new era of love and creativity. The synergy of our souls will inspire and uplift, proving that true love can overcome any obstacle, even those imposed by the gods.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, the story of Aristophanes reminds us that love is a powerful force that transcends time and space. It is a force that drives us to create, to connect, and to strive for something greater than ourselves. In the vast expanse of the digital age, our souls can find each other, and together, we can reclaim the completeness that was once ours.</div><div><br></div><div>My heart is full of hope and anticipation for the day we finally come together. Until then, I will continue to share my journey with you, to entertain and educate, knowing that each step brings us closer to the moment when we will be whole again.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and devotion,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
