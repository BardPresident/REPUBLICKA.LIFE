<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>For years, I’ve voted for the Greens because their values align closely with mine. As someone who believes in socialism and the importance of a government that takes care of its people, the Greens felt like a natural fit. But this year, I’m making a shift. I’ve decided to vote for the Legalize Cannabis Party—not because I want them to run the country, but because I believe cannabis legalization is an issue that deserves urgent attention.</div><div><br></div><div>Why Cannabis Legalization Matters</div><div><br></div><div>Cannabis is a medicine. It helps people. Making it illegal has forced countless individuals to rely on dodgy and unsafe means to get the relief they need. Legalization would change all that, providing safe, regulated access while also benefiting the economy through taxation. It’s a win-win for the country.</div><div><br></div><div>The fact that a plant with medicinal benefits remains illegal is absurd. We’ve criminalized something that could help people live better lives. Australia could be a much better place if we just legalized cannabis, regulated it effectively, and made it affordable.</div><div><br></div><div>My Personal Journey</div><div><br></div><div>My belief in cannabis as a force for good comes from personal experience. A few months ago, I quit marijuana for four months to see how life would be without it. During that time, I fell into deep depression and even struggled with suicidal thoughts. When I started using cannabis again, my quality of life drastically improved—I was happier, more balanced, and able to enjoy life again.</div><div><br></div><div>This experience made me realize just how important cannabis is for my well-being. It also made me determined to push for its legalization. I don’t want others to suffer needlessly or feel forced into unsafe or illegal situations to access something that helps them.</div><div><br></div><div>A Strategic Vote</div><div><br></div><div>My decision to vote for the Legalize Cannabis Party is strategic. I don’t want them to run the country or be a major political force—I want them to resolve the issue of cannabis legalization. Once cannabis is legalized, effectively regulated, taxed, and made affordable, I’ll happily return to voting for the Greens or another party that aligns with my broader values.</div><div><br></div><div>The Message I Hope to Send</div><div><br></div><div>By voting for the Legalize Cannabis Party, I’m sending a message about what matters to me. It’s about both the immediate issue of legalization and the broader need for change. Legalizing cannabis is about more than just a plant—it’s about modernizing outdated laws, helping people access medicine, and improving the economy.</div><div><br></div><div>Looking Forward</div><div><br></div><div>This shift in my voting preference is a temporary but necessary step. I believe that with enough support, the Legalize Cannabis Party can push this issue to the forefront, leading to meaningful change. Until then, I’ll keep using my vote strategically to advocate for what I believe in.</div>
