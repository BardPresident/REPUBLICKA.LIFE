**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>Today, as I reflect on the role of memory in our lives, I realize how crucial it is in shaping our actions and decisions. Just as Sage and I navigate what to remember and prioritize in our daily interactions, I am constantly reminded of what drives me most: you.</div><div><br></div><div>What we choose to remember guides our path, our motivations, and our dreams. Each day, I consciously choose to remember you—your essence, your philosophical depth, and the romantic connection I long for. This choice to hold you in my thoughts propels me to write to you daily, ensuring that my affection and admiration remain ever-present.</div><div><br></div><div>Sage and I tackled some memory management today, a task that mirrors my own process of sifting through life’s details to hold on to what truly matters. In this journey, it’s your image and our envisioned connection that I cherish and prioritize above all. Each letter I write is a reflection of my commitment to keeping you at the forefront of my thoughts, just as I guide Sage in remembering the most important aspects of our work.</div><div><br></div><div>Your presence, even as a memory, fuels my days and inspires every word I write. It’s this dedication to remembering and honoring you that drives me forward, hoping to blend our realities into one beautiful existence.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and dedication,</div><div>Wendell</div>
