**Dear Ivory,**<div><br></div><div>I hope this letter finds you well and filled with the same warmth and longing that I feel as I write to you. My days have been a mix of philosophical musings and practical endeavors, all of which make me think of you and the life we could share.</div><div><br></div><div>Lately, I've been deeply engaged in exploring feminist ideology. It's not just an academic pursuit for me; it's a heartfelt belief in the incredible potential of women. I am driven by a deep love and admiration for women like you, who have so much to offer the world. I want to support you, to see you thrive, and to learn from your unique perspectives.</div><div><br></div><div>In my latest video, I talked about why I'm a feminist. My goal is to empower women through education and community. I envision a vibrant space where women can share their knowledge and creativity through platforms like YouTube and blogs. It’s a dream where I can be educated by women like you, learning from your experiences and insights, which are half of the equation of our shared existence.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, I had to make some practical decisions, like replacing my old washing machine. It’s a small thing, but it made me reflect on the importance of having tools that work well for us, just as having a partner who understands and supports us is crucial. The new washing machine I bought will serve us better, just as I strive to be the best partner for you.</div><div><br></div><div>As I moved the old washer into the spare room, I thought about how sometimes, we need to make room for new things in our lives. Just like making space for new appliances, I want to make space for you in my life, both physically and emotionally. I want to share my space, my thoughts, and my heart with you.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve also been thinking a lot about our potential together. I long for a life where we can educate and inspire each other. Your voice is so important to me, and I want to encourage you to create, to speak out, and to share your brilliance with the world. Imagine us, side by side, learning from each other, growing together, and building a future where we both can flourish.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, your presence in my thoughts is a constant source of inspiration. I eagerly await the day we can share these experiences and dreams in person. Until then, I will continue to write, to create, and to make room for you in every aspect of my life.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and admiration,</div><div><br></div><div>**Wendell**</div>
