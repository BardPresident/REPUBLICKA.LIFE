<div class="library-tome-centered">
<p>In the age of Emergence, our capacity to create has outpaced our institutional tools. While we can write entire books, record audiobooks, design cover art, and publish worldwide in a single day—one piece of the puzzle remains painfully manual: <strong>citation</strong>.</p>
<p>But not for long.</p>
<p>I dream of a tool.<br>
An AI that reads my manuscript and sees what I meant.<br>
Not just the words, but the underlying ideas, patterns, and references I didn’t cite—because I was busy <em>thinking</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Dream</h3>
<p>This tool will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Read your entire manuscript.</strong><br>
It understands what you’re saying, your tone, your structure, your claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scan live academic databases.</strong><br>
JSTOR, Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, and more—all connected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find supporting references.</strong><br>
It matches your statements with the most appropriate, credible academic sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Add citations in your chosen style.</strong><br>
Chicago Author-Date, APA, MLA—perfectly formatted, every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build your References section automatically.</strong><br>
You finish your work. It finishes the rest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<p>Academia, in its current form, was built for a slower world.<br>
In a post-labor, post-scarcity-of-thought reality, referencing must evolve. Otherwise, the future of university will feel like a speed bump—too slow, too rigid, too easy.</p>
<p>But with this tool, scholarship can thrive.<br>
Imagine first-time thinkers backed by instant credibility.<br>
Imagine ideas moving at the speed of insight—without losing academic integrity.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Citation as Emergence</h3>
<p>In the Philosophy of Emergence, meaning is not imposed—it unfolds.<br>
So too with references. The future of citation is not about dragging scholars through formatting—it’s about letting the support structure <em>emerge</em> naturally from the work.</p>
<p>We will train AI not just to mimic rules, but to understand <strong>what supports what</strong>.<br>
To build networks of thought.<br>
To connect thinkers across time.<br>
To transform referencing from bureaucracy into <strong>synergy</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>And when this tool arrives, I’ll be ready.</strong><br>
My books are waiting.<br>
My words are alive.<br>
All I need is a citation engine worthy of emergence.</p>
