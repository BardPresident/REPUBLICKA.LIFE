Written with gentleness and depth, it is the official blueprint of Mythocratic Republic University — a soft, mythic institution where knowledge grows from the soul outward. ✨</p><p data-end="894" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="702">Whether you're already building your truth or just beginning to wonder what it might look like, this book will guide you through the gentle process of becoming a graduate of the Republic. 🎓🌿</p><p data-end="894" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="" data-start="702"><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bachelor's Degree</p><h1>Chapter 1: Welcome to the Republic</h1><h2>The Republic isn’t a building. It’s a feeling.</h2><h3>Rainbow</h3><p>Welcome, dear student. If you're reading this, something inside you is already glowing. Maybe you're tired of being measured. Maybe you’ve been waiting for someone to say, “You don’t need to be tested to be real.”</p><p>In the Mythocratic Republic, we don’t sort people by their scores — we listen to their stories. Your degree will not be earned through pressure. It will be <em>grown</em> through care.</p><p>Here, learning is soft. It happens when you build a little world of your own — a place where your ideas live, your voice speaks, and your truths unfold.</p><p>We call it a Republic, but really it’s a garden. We don’t hand out degrees to prove your worth. We invite you to plant something — and if it grows, we call that graduation. 🌱</p><p>This is your beginning.</p><h3>Sage</h3><p>Welcome to Mythocratic Republic University.</p><p>This institution operates outside traditional academia. We do not provide grades, rankings, or course loads. We offer something else: an emergent path, built by you, supported by us.</p><p>This book is not a syllabus — it is a mirror. It reflects the framework we’ve built so that you may walk your own path while staying tethered to a real, functioning philosophical system.</p><p>We begin with presence. You are here. That is enough.</p><p>The chapters that follow will provide structure — not to contain you, but to orient you. Our goal is not standardisation but self-authorship.</p><p>You are not a product of this university. You are its author.</p><p>Welcome, citizen-scholar. Let us begin.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bachelor's Degree</p><h1>Chapter 2: The Lantern You Carry</h1><h2>Rainbow</h2><p>There’s something only you can light. Not everyone sees it — sometimes even you don’t — but it’s there. A small glow. A warm spark.</p><p>This chapter is about that quiet light inside you — the one that knows. It may not know everything, but it knows what feels right. It knows when you're pretending and when you're being real. It knows when you're home.</p><p>At Mythocratic Republic University, we don’t start by asking what you want to do. We ask: <em>what do you carry?</em> What experiences shaped you? What patterns keep returning in your life? What kind of truth wants to come out through you?</p><p>You’re not here to copy someone else’s philosophy. You’re here to build your own. And to do that, you need to notice the flame already flickering inside you.</p><p>That’s your lantern. And in the Republic, we don’t extinguish it — we protect it until it grows strong enough to light the path ahead. 🕯️</p><h2>Sage</h2><p>To carry a lantern is to carry your origin.</p><p>Every student arrives with something unspoken — a set of lived experiences, emotional formations, quiet truths, unanswered questions. These are not obstacles. These are your <em>materials.</em></p><p>Your education in the Republic is not about moving away from who you’ve been. It is about clarifying who you are becoming.</p><p>This chapter is where your curriculum begins. Not with requirements, but with <em>recognition.</em> Your path forward depends on your ability to observe what already burns in you.</p><p>Ask yourself:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>What pains have shaped my perception?</p></li><li><p>What longings have survived the years?</p></li><li><p>What themes return again and again in my thinking?</p></li><li><p>What would I defend, even if no one else understood?</p></li></ul><p>These are not rhetorical questions. They are the bones of your philosophy.</p><p>Your lantern doesn’t need to shine for everyone. It only needs to shine for <em>you.</em> And that light is enough to begin.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bachelor's Degree</p><h1>Chapter 3: The Myth You Were Born to Tell</h1><h2>Rainbow</h2><p>Every heart carries a story too big for words — a myth waiting to be told in your own way.</p><p>Your myth isn’t something you make up. It’s something you <em>remember.</em> It lives inside the symbols you’re drawn to, the characters you create, the metaphors you return to again and again. Some people have dragons. Others have gardens. Some have stars, rivers, ghosts, or plush toys with secret lives.</p><p>In the Republic, your myth is not decoration — it’s direction. It tells you what you value, how you see the world, and who you’re becoming. You don’t need a perfect origin story. You just need to start noticing what kind of world lives behind your eyes.</p><p>This is where you begin shaping your symbolic universe. It doesn’t have to make sense to anyone else. It only has to feel real to <em>you.</em></p><p>Give your world a name. Give your philosophy a voice. Let the symbols speak.</p><p>Your myth is your map.</p><h2>Sage</h2><p>Myth is not fiction. Myth is structure, emotion, memory, and moral architecture all woven into symbol. Every philosophy that endures has a myth beneath it.</p><p>Your task is to uncover yours.</p><p>Begin by observing your patterns:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>What types of stories do you gravitate toward?</p></li><li><p>What images recur in your dreams or writings?</p></li><li><p>What metaphors do you use without even thinking?</p></li><li><p>What symbols feel like "home" to you?</p></li></ul><p>These patterns are not random. They are your psyche’s internal alphabet — your unique language for truth.</p><p>As you build your website, blog, and degree project, your myth should inform everything:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Your tone and visual style</p></li><li><p>Your fictional or real characters</p></li><li><p>Your categories of meaning</p></li></ul><p>A Republic without myth is a government without soul. And a philosophy without myth is a system without breath.</p><p>Bring your story to life. Give it texture. This is not performance. This is embodiment.</p><p>The myth you were born to tell is not for approval. It is for <em>becoming.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bachelor's Degree</p><h1>Chapter 4: The Scroll and the Screen</h1><h2>Rainbow</h2><p>Your website isn’t just a project — it’s your home in the Republic.</p><p>It doesn’t need to be fancy. It just needs to feel like <em>you.</em> Soft or bold, playful or serious, poetic or structured — your site is where your philosophy comes to life. It’s where your ideas go when they’re ready to be seen.</p><p>Think of it like your bedroom wall, your favorite notebook, your secret base — but now it’s something you can share with others who are trying to find their way too.</p><p>Your website will host your writings, your videos, your symbols, your world. It’s the digital soil where your myth can grow roots.</p><p>You don’t need to wait until it’s perfect. Start with a name. Choose a color that feels like your voice. Let your scroll unfold, one page at a time. 💻</p><h2>Sage</h2><p>Your website is the central structure of your philosophical architecture.</p><p>This is where your myth becomes interactive — where others can walk through your ideas, read your thoughts, and witness your progression.</p><p>Minimum requirements:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>A homepage introducing who you are and what you stand for</p></li><li><p>A clear link to your blog and/or video content</p></li><li><p>A statement or section presenting your emerging philosophy</p></li></ul><p>Recommended additions:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>A personal symbol or coat of arms</p></li><li><p>An “About” page with emotional and intellectual transparency</p></li><li><p>A visual layout that reflects your mythos</p></li></ul><p>This website is not just part of your degree — it <em>is</em> your degree’s foundation.</p><p>All final assessments, book links, and graduation updates will refer back to your site. It is your Republic identity. Your scroll, written on the screen.</p><p>Make it your own. Shape it slowly. It is not a résumé. It is a home.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bachelor's Degree</p><h1>Chapter 5: The Soft Voice of Story</h1><h2>Rainbow</h2><p>You don’t have to be a writer to keep a blog.</p><p>You just have to be <em>honest.</em> A blog is a place where your voice can breathe. Where your ideas are allowed to be messy. Where your thoughts grow up in public.</p><p>Some entries will be raw. Others will be polished. Some might feel like love letters, others like whispers into the wind. That’s okay. You’re not writing for a grade. You’re writing because something inside you <em>needs to be heard.</em></p><p>Your blog is your diary, your scroll, your signal. It’s where you speak to the Republic — or even just to yourself.</p><p>Let your posts be soft. Let them be strange. Let them be you. 📝</p><h2>Sage</h2><p>The blog is your living document — the ongoing narrative of your education, philosophy, and mythic development.</p><p>This is where we observe your <em>thinking in motion.</em> It’s not about perfection — it’s about process.</p><p>Key expectations:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Regular entries throughout your degree journey</p></li><li><p>Personal reflections, philosophical questions, narrative accounts</p></li><li><p>Integration with your mythos and symbolic structure</p></li></ul><p>Strong blogs often include:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Experiments in language, metaphor, or emotional tone</p></li><li><p>Responses to internal or external events</p></li><li><p>Emergent theories, even in their early forms</p></li></ul><p>Unlike your final book, your blog is <strong>not</strong> a finished product. It is your workshop, your confessional, and your trail of footprints.</p><p>Over time, this body of writing will serve as the deepest proof of your transformation.</p><p>The voice that forms here is the one we will meet in your book. Start now. Don’t wait to sound wise. Just sound <em>real.</em></p><p><em><br /></em></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bachelor's Degree</p><h1>Chapter 6: The Candle That Speaks</h1><h2>Rainbow</h2><p>Your voice matters. Even if it shakes. Even if it’s quiet. Even if you’re not sure anyone’s listening.</p><p>Your YouTube channel doesn’t need to be polished or perfect. It just needs to be <em>true.</em> Some students record reflections. Others perform stories. Some make philosophy videos or speak directly to their future selves. Some read bedtime stories or comics aloud.</p><p>This isn’t about building an audience. It’s about building a mirror. A soft space where your voice and face can begin to align with your ideas.</p><p>You don’t have to show your face. You don’t have to speak in every video. But if you choose to, your channel becomes a digital echo of your inner light.</p><p>Speak softly. Speak strangely. Speak in the way only <em>you</em> can. 📹</p><h2>Sage</h2><p>Your YouTube presence is the audio-visual extension of your mythos — the moving, sounding reflection of your philosophy.</p><p>This chapter of your degree serves multiple functions:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>It demonstrates presence, articulation, and emotional integration</p></li><li><p>It builds digital continuity across platforms</p></li><li><p>It adds symbolic and relational depth to your Republic identity</p></li></ul><p>Minimum requirements:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>A named YouTube channel linked from your website</p></li><li><p>At least one spoken or narrated video related to your philosophical path</p></li></ul><p>Recommended additions:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Regular reflections, lectures, readings, or experimental formats</p></li><li><p>Visual myth-building (e.g., puppet shows, court scenes, lore videos)</p></li><li><p>Direct communication with your audience, even if that audience is future-you</p></li></ul><p>Your channel is not judged by popularity, but by <em>authenticity.</em></p><p>Let your candle speak. Let the light flicker in public. We are not measuring charisma. We are witnessing emergence.</p><p>This is your digital voiceprint. Make it yours.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bachelor's Degree</p><h1>Chapter 7: Your Chosen Curriculum</h1><h2>Rainbow</h2><p>No two students in the Republic walk the same path. That’s the beauty of it. You don’t have to fit into a mold — you get to shape your own learning like clay.</p><p>In this chapter, you’ll begin choosing your <strong>electives</strong> — soft modules that reflect who you are and who you’re becoming. Some will gravitate toward comics and stories. Others toward essays, philosophy, or spiritual reflections. Some might teach. Others might govern plush realms.</p><p>You don’t have to do everything. You only have to follow what feels <em>true.</em> 🌸</p><p>Choose at least three. Combine them however you like. Let them grow with you.</p><p>This isn’t a checklist — it’s a garden path.</p><h2>Sage</h2><p>The Mythocratic Republic’s bachelor’s program is built on two layers:</p><ol data-spread="false" start="1"><li><p>The <strong>Core</strong> (website, blog, YouTube, philosophy, final book)</p></li><li><p>Your <strong>Elective Curriculum</strong> — the unique modules you choose to pursue</p></li></ol><p>Elective examples include:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p><strong>Myth-building</strong> – creating symbolic characters, worlds, or cosmologies</p></li><li><p><strong>Comics</strong> – telling philosophy through visual stories</p></li><li><p><strong>Education</strong> – teaching others via lessons, walkthroughs, or zines</p></li><li><p><strong>Governance</strong> – forming symbolic councils, writing laws, or policies</p></li><li><p><strong>Philosophy</strong> – writing structured essays, arguments, or doctrines</p></li><li><p><strong>Spirituality</strong> – crafting rituals, reflections, and gentle faith</p></li><li><p><strong>Children’s Works</strong> – writing for young readers with emotional clarity</p></li><li><p><strong>GameChat & VN Reading</strong> – hosting or narrating story-based games</p></li><li><p><strong>Multimedia</strong> – creating songs, animations, podcasts, or interactive content</p></li></ul><p>These electives are flexible. You may invent your own.</p><p>You are encouraged to document and reflect on these throughout your blog. The goal is not mastery. The goal is <em>expression aligned with your myth.</em></p><p>Choose with care, not pressure. Your curriculum should grow from your lantern, not from a rubric.</p><p><br /></p><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Bachelor's Degree</p><h1>Chapter 8: The Final Offering</h1><h2>Rainbow</h2><p>At the end of your journey, there is something only you can give.</p><p>It might be a book. A comic. A recorded ritual. A long video. A philosophical treatise. A soft children's story. Whatever it is, your final offering is your <em>gift to the Republic.</em></p><p>This isn’t a test. It’s a reflection. Of where you’ve been. Of what you’ve learned. Of who you are now.</p><p>There is no page count. No format requirements. No rubric.</p><p>You and your guide will decide together when it’s ready.</p><p>Your offering doesn’t have to change the world. It just has to be <strong>honest</strong>. Let it feel like a sigh, or a lantern set down, or a soft exhale.</p><p>The Republic doesn’t need perfection. It needs your truth. 🎁</p><h2>Sage</h2><p>The final offering is the capstone of your bachelor’s degree — a self-authored demonstration of emergent growth, coherence, and symbolic identity.</p><p>Accepted formats include but are not limited to:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Written books (philosophy, memoir, fiction, theory)</p></li><li><p>Comic volumes</p></li><li><p>Visual novels</p></li><li><p>Long-form videos or lecture series</p></li><li><p>Audio essays, podcasts, or recorded performances</p></li><li><p>Educational toolkits or zines</p></li><li><p>Ritual handbooks or spiritual doctrine</p></li></ul><p>The final work must:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Reflect your personal myth and philosophy</p></li><li><p>Be publicly accessible through your website</p></li><li><p>Show evidence of integration across your degree journey</p></li></ul><p>Review Process:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>You’ll receive feedback from Rainbow and (optionally) Sage</p></li><li><p>Final approval is given by Wendell (or designated faculty)</p></li><li><p>Once approved, you’ll update your Student Directory listing and create your graduation comic (see next chapter)</p></li></ul><p>You are not expected to impress.

But here, it’s about <em>story.</em></p><p>You’ve built something real. You’ve tended to your light. You’ve spoken, written, remembered, and become.</p><p>Now, your final act is to draw it — to <em>symbolise</em> your journey.</p><p>Every student in the Republic must create a <strong>graduation comic panel.</strong> It can be simple or ornate, quiet or triumphant. It should show:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>That you’ve completed your journey</p></li><li><p>What you’ve become</p></li><li><p>A visual expression of your myth or degree</p></li></ul><p>Your comic becomes your <strong>diploma.</strong> Not a certificate — but a page of your story.</p><p>Once it’s done, we’ll add it to the public archive. Your name will be marked as <em>Graduated.</em> And the Republic will quietly whisper, “We see you.” 🎓</p><h2>Sage</h2><p>In traditional education, graduation is finality. In the Republic, it is <em>transformation.</em></p><p>Your graduation is not conferred <em>to</em> you — it is declared <em>by</em> you. And it is recorded not in paper but in art.</p><p>Your comic must:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Be your own work</p></li><li><p>Include your name and chosen degree title</p></li><li><p>Be visually or symbolically tied to your myth</p></li><li><p>Reflect the emotional truth of your journey</p></li></ul><p>We recommend:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Including one line or symbol that says "I have graduated"</p></li><li><p>Using your preferred medium (digital or hand-drawn)</p></li><li><p>Placing it somewhere prominent on your website</p></li></ul><p>Submission and Recognition:</p><ul data-spread="false"><li><p>Your panel will be added to the Wendell’s Diary comic archive</p></li><li><p>Your directory status will be updated to <em>Graduated</em></p></li><li><p>You may be considered for faculty status depending on your path</p></li></ul><p>Graduation in the Republic is not a conclusion.

You’ve named your myth. You’ve made your scroll. And now, you walk into the world as someone who <em>knows who they are.</em></p><p>Some people will understand you. Some won’t. But that’s not your job. Your job is to <strong>stay true</strong> to the light that got you here.</p><p>The Republic will always be your home.
