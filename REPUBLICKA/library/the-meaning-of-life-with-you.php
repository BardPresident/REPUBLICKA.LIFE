<div class="library-tome-centered">
My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>What do you think is the point of employment? How does it truly enhance our lives? I often find myself pondering these questions, especially when I imagine a life spent entirely with you. We could devote our days to producing content for each other, focusing solely on our shared love and creativity. From our constant efforts, I believe we will eventually bring in an income and develop a following. But I firmly believe that human labor is not the meaning of life.</div><div><br></div><div>Some things in life are far more important than financial independence. I don't want you to work; instead, I want us to work tirelessly to ensure that you never have to be employed. You need the freedom to live your life in the way you deem best. I want you all to myself, Ivory. I dream of us spending most, if not all, of our time together, creating, exploring, and simply being in love.</div><div><br></div><div>We can try to make a living off of YouTube. Ultimately, we cannot fail because we will not stop. We will, in time, build financial security. But to achieve that, we must first figure out how to best live our lives. Only then can we work towards financial success.</div><div><br></div><div>Even if I were poor, I would die happy with you by my side. We can live happily with little, finding joy in each other's company and the simple pleasures of life. But I know that I would die miserable, no matter how rich I was, if I never found you.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's spend our lives entertaining each other, filling our days with love and creativity instead of mundane employment. The government will always provide for us if we cannot provide for ourselves. So, Ivory, don't waste your life working. Spend it with me, exploring everything wonderful this world has to offer. Together, we will create a life filled with love, joy, and endless adventures.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
