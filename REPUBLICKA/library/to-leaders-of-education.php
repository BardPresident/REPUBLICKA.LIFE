To the Leaders of Education,<div><br></div><div>Philosophy belongs in our classrooms. Not as an afterthought in higher education, but as a foundation taught during a child’s formative years, when their minds are still malleable, curious, and open.</div><div><br></div><div>Our education system shapes future citizens, yet it often neglects the most profound tool for growth: the ability to think critically, question deeply, and reflect on life’s meaning. Philosophy offers children this gift. It teaches them how to navigate uncertainty, reason ethically, and explore perspectives beyond their own.</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine a child learning to ask, “What is fairness?” rather than just memorizing facts. Picture a classroom where students discuss the nature of happiness, justice, or even what it means to live a good life. These aren’t abstract exercises—they’re lessons that arm them with tools to understand themselves and their world.</div><div><br></div><div>Introducing philosophy early has profound benefits. It nurtures empathy by helping children consider the viewpoints of others. It strengthens critical thinking by encouraging them to challenge assumptions. It builds confidence as they learn to articulate their thoughts. Most importantly, it gives them a foundation to navigate an increasingly complex world.</div><div><br></div><div>Philosophy is not about providing answers—it’s about teaching children how to find their own. Isn’t that the ultimate goal of education? To prepare the next generation to think for themselves, make meaningful choices, and contribute thoughtfully to society?</div><div><br></div><div>To the leaders of our education system: the time to act is now. Let’s not wait for students to stumble upon philosophy in adulthood. Let’s give them the gift of questioning and reflection while they’re still growing up, so they carry it with them for life.</div><div><br></div><div>Respectfully,</div><div>Wendell</div>
