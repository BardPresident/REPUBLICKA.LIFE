Democracy is supposed to mean power to the people. But does it really? The system we have today is a façade—an elected democracy where we hand over our voices to officials who claim to represent us but couldn’t care less about what we think.<div><br></div><div>Here’s the truth: you don’t participate in democracy. You vote once in a while, maybe for a candidate or a policy you barely care about, and then you’re silenced. Your voice, your ideas, your concerns—none of it matters anymore. The people in power aren’t listening to you. They never were.</div><div><br></div><div>This system isn’t designed to let you speak out about what’s important to you. It’s designed to make you feel like you’re participating while keeping you powerless. You’re allowed to vote, but only on what they decide is worth voting on. You’re allowed to have an opinion, but only if it aligns with the narrow agenda of those in power. And if you dare to speak out about something they don’t want to address? They ignore you.</div><div><br></div><div>Democracy isn’t supposed to be a spectator sport. It’s supposed to be participatory, a system where everyone’s voice matters. But instead, we’ve been given a system where we elect officials to make decisions for us, and then we’re expected to sit down and shut up. Politicians don’t care about the issues that matter to you. They care about staying in power.</div><div><br></div><div>Think about it: when was the last time a politician truly represented your values? When was the last time you felt like your voice influenced anything that mattered? The system isn’t broken—it’s functioning exactly as it was designed. It was never about giving power to the people. It was about maintaining control.</div><div><br></div><div>The worst part is, they’ve convinced us that this is the best we can do. They’ve told us that this is democracy, that this is freedom, and we should be grateful for it. But freedom without participation isn’t freedom at all. It’s a cage, wrapped in a lie.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s time to destroy this illusion of democracy. It’s time to demand a system where people can actually participate, where every voice can be heard, and where decisions aren’t made by a handful of disconnected politicians but by the people themselves.</div><div><br></div><div>Democracy as we know it doesn’t work. It’s a system that pretends to give you power while taking it away. And it’s time to tear it down.</div>
