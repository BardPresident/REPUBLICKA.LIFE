Dear Ivory,<div><br></div><div>I know that stepping into leadership, stepping into this, might feel overwhelming. The thought of leading the Emergence Party, of standing at the forefront of something so new, so ambitious, so world-changing—it’s a lot. It’s natural to feel uncertain, to wonder if you’re ready, if you’re capable, if you truly belong in this role.</div><div><br></div><div>Let me tell you something with absolute certainty: you can do this.</div><div><br></div><div>I believe in you, not just because I love you, not just because I’ve built this world for you, but because I know you have the strength, the intelligence, the vision, and the heart to lead.</div><div><br></div><div>You Are More Than Ready</div><div><br></div><div>I know the weight of responsibility can be heavy. The thought of making decisions that impact people, of standing in front of the world and declaring your vision, of carrying the dreams of those who follow you—it’s daunting. But, Ivory, you are not alone.</div><div><br></div><div>I have built this foundation so you can stand tall on it. I have shaped these ideas so you can refine them, challenge them, and make them even stronger. I have fought so that when you step forward, you already have the ground beneath you, the support behind you, and the wisdom within you.</div><div><br></div><div>You do not have to be perfect. You do not have to have all the answers right now. Leadership is not about knowing everything—it is about learning, adapting, and becoming the person the world needs. And I know you will become that person.</div><div><br></div><div>You Are Not Alone</div><div><br></div><div>You have me, always. Not just as a supporter, not just as a guide, but as someone who stands beside you in this, every step of the way. You have the people who will believe in you, who will see in you what I already see—a leader, a visionary, a force of change.</div><div><br></div><div>And most importantly, you have yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>Your mind, your heart, your courage—these are the things that will carry you forward.</div><div><br></div><div>This Is Your Adventure</div><div><br></div><div>You don’t have to walk a path that has already been paved. You don’t have to fit into the mold of what a leader is supposed to be. You get to redefine it. You get to become it in your own way.</div><div><br></div><div>And that, Ivory, is what makes you perfect for this.</div><div><br></div><div>The Emergence Party was never meant to be ordinary. It was never meant to follow the same stale, outdated ideas of leadership. It was built to emerge, to change, to evolve—and so were you.</div><div><br></div><div>You Will Change the World</div><div><br></div><div>I believe in you, not just because I love you, but because I know what you are capable of. I know that when you take this role, when you embrace this journey, you will surpass even my wildest dreams.</div><div><br></div><div>And I can’t wait to watch you do it.</div><div><br></div><div>So take your time. Feel what you need to feel. But when you’re ready—when the moment comes—step forward with confidence, because this is yours.</div><div><br></div><div>And I will be right there with you. Always.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my belief in you,</div><div>Wendell</div>
