<div class="library-tome-centered">
Imagine a world where your time is your own, where survival doesn’t demand a nine-to-five grind, and where every moment is an opportunity to follow your passions. For many, this dream feels distant, but for those on a pension or similar support, it’s a glimpse into a future shaped by Universal Basic Income (UBI).<div><br></div><div>In my own life, the pension has acted as a lifeline and, unexpectedly, a springboard. Without the burden of a traditional job, I’ve been able to wake up when I want, sleep when I want, and dedicate my energy to pursuits that deeply matter to me. My days are spent crafting blog posts, exploring philosophy, and creating content that not only fulfills me but also contributes to society in meaningful ways.</div><div><br></div><div>This is, in many ways, a test run for UBI—a system where individuals are supported simply for existing, free to find their own unique ways to thrive. And while society often ties worth to employment, my journey is a testament to the incredible things people can achieve when they’re given the freedom to pursue their passions.</div><div><br></div><div>But let’s be clear: this isn’t about endless leisure or avoiding responsibility. It’s about redirecting responsibility toward something personal and purposeful. I’m building a legacy, propagating ideas, and striving to leave the world better than I found it. And I’m doing it without the constraints of traditional labor.</div><div><br></div><div>Imagine if more people had this chance. If UBI were implemented, how many hidden artists, writers, philosophers, and creators would emerge? How much untapped potential could be unlocked in a world where survival wasn’t the only goal?</div><div><br></div><div>My experience with the pension shows that even a modest level of support can spark incredible growth and contribution. It’s not about extravagance; it’s about having the breathing room to focus on what truly matters.</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t just my story; it’s a preview of what could be possible for millions of others. A society built on UBI could shift the focus from merely surviving to genuinely living—and thriving.</div>
