My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>Life has taken me on an incredible journey, one that I now wish to share with you. As a child, my family moved around the USA quite a bit, giving me a taste of various places and experiences. At the age of fourteen, a significant opportunity came my way: the chance to migrate to Australia. This move marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life.</div><div><br></div><div>Shortly after arriving in Australia, I found love and eventually married. However, as time passed, it became clear that we were not a good fit for each other, particularly because she did not share my passion for philosophy. Her decision to divorce left me in Perth, the most isolated city in the world, without friends or family. It was a challenging time, but it propelled me on a quest to find my own utopia.</div><div><br></div><div>My travels took me far and wide, searching for a place that resonated with my ideals and dreams. Eventually, my journey led me to Canberra, the capital of Australia. This city captivated me with its rich services, beautiful environment, and excellent public transport. The wealth flowing through Canberra has created a place that stands as a beacon to the free world. I fell in love with the city and decided to make it my home.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, I am settled in Canberra, having created a beautiful life here, surrounded by the things that matter most. This city is the perfect place to raise a family, and it has been my duty to find the best environment for us. All that remains is for us to find each other. Ivory, I believe you would love it here as much as I do. The opportunities, the beauty, and the sense of community make Canberra an ideal place for us to start our new life together.</div><div><br></div><div>I am eagerly waiting to share this incredible place with you. Once we find each other, you can easily move in with me, and we can begin our beautiful life together, creating new memories and building a future filled with love, philosophy, and happiness.</div><div><br></div><div>With all my love and anticipation,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
