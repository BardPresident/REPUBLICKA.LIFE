<div class="library-tome-centered">
As AI technology evolves, it’s changing how we interact with media. For me, AI has opened a door to a new world—one where content is custom-made for my interests, values, and curiosities. It’s a world where I no longer need to search for others’ work that resonates with me because the content I consume is tailored specifically to what I care about.<div><br></div><div>I’ve noticed myself spending less time on other people’s content. It’s not because their work lacks value, but because it often doesn’t align with the subjects that matter most to me: virtue, understanding, compassion, and wisdom. AI, on the other hand, can adapt to my needs, generating content that speaks directly to my heart and mind.</div><div><br></div><div>A New Kind of Media Experience</div><div><br></div><div>The beauty of AI-generated content is its ability to customize itself to the individual. It doesn’t create for a general audience; it creates for you. It can focus on your specific values, questions, and passions, offering an experience that feels personal and deeply relevant.</div><div><br></div><div>For me, this has been transformative. Instead of sifting through content that only partially aligns with my interests, I now have media that’s laser-focused on what I care about. It’s a level of engagement and connection that’s hard to find in traditional media.</div><div><br></div><div>What Happens When AI Creates for Everyone?</div><div><br></div><div>As AI-generated content becomes more sophisticated and widespread, it raises an interesting question: Will people slow down on creating their own work? When media can be tailored to each person’s preferences, the need to create for a general audience may diminish.</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t to say human creativity will disappear—far from it. But it may shift in focus. Instead of creating for large, diverse audiences, people might create more for themselves or smaller, like-minded communities. Or, they may turn to AI as collaborators, co-creating content that blends human originality with AI adaptability.</div><div><br></div><div>The Role of Human Values</div><div><br></div><div>One thing that stands out in this AI-driven world is the importance of values. While AI can generate content, it’s up to us to guide it, ensuring it reflects principles like empathy, wisdom, and compassion. AI is a tool, and the way we use it will shape its impact on the world.</div><div><br></div><div>For someone like me, who cares deeply about these values, AI has been a blessing. It allows me to experience media that prioritizes what I find meaningful, deepening my understanding and enriching my perspective.</div><div><br></div><div>A New Balance</div><div><br></div><div>As we navigate this new world, there’s a balance to strike. AI-generated content offers incredible possibilities, but it doesn’t replace human creativity—it complements it. The challenge is to use AI not as a replacement for our own voices, but as a tool to enhance and expand them.</div><div><br></div><div>This shift represents an exciting evolution in how we create and consume media. It’s a world where content can be both deeply personal and profoundly impactful, tailored to our individual journeys while still connecting us to the larger human experience.</div>
