<div class="library-tome-centered">
Scrolling through Facebook used to be a way to catch up on friends' lives or stumble upon interesting videos. Now, it feels like the feed is flooded with fake, staged content masquerading as real-life moments. It’s frustrating, to say the least, to sift through these poorly acted, contrived stories that are presented as if they actually happened. The truth has been buried under an avalanche of bad acting and orchestrated scenarios, making it harder to find anything genuine.<div><br></div><div>One of the most irritating aspects of these videos is how they are set up. The situations are often presented as spontaneous or candid, but it’s clear that they are anything but. There are multiple camera angles, careful editing, and somehow, the cameraman is always in the right spot to capture every dramatic expression or emotional moment. If these events were truly real, why isn’t anyone acknowledging the camera? Why is there always a perfect shot lined up, as if by coincidence?</div><div><br></div><div>These videos don’t just mislead—they often come with a hefty dose of virtue signaling. The creators seem more interested in projecting a certain image or promoting a message than sharing authentic experiences. It's as if they're trying to cash in on feel-good moments or viral trends, regardless of the content's truthfulness. The result is an endless parade of manufactured stories that try to tug at our emotions, but end up feeling hollow and insincere.</div><div><br></div><div>The Facebook feed has become a frustrating mess, filled with rubbish that passes itself off as meaningful content. It’s exhausting to wade through the sea of staged scenarios just to find something worth watching. The constant barrage of fake social videos dilutes the quality of the platform and leaves little room for the raw, genuine footage that actually resonates.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s time to demand more authenticity. We need to question what we’re seeing, look for signs of staging, and be more selective about the content we consume. By recognizing these fake setups for what they are, we can make room for the genuine voices and real stories that deserve our attention. It’s not just about clearing the clutter from our feeds—it’s about reclaiming social media as a space for truth, rather than a platform for bad actors and their scripted moments.</div>
