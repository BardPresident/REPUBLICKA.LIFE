<div class="library-tome-centered">
I didn’t want it to be this way.<div><br></div><div>I wanted to protect society from the beginning. I wanted to use my philosophy, my creativity, and my work to build a better world—a world where compassion, understanding, and connection thrive. But society didn’t give me that chance.</div><div><br></div><div>For the past 15 years, I’ve reached out, created, and tried to connect. And for 15 years, I’ve been rejected. Again and again. This isn’t just about me—it’s about a system that isolates, alienates, and fails those who think differently. A system that allows loneliness to fester in a world of 9 billion people. That’s not just flawed; it’s catastrophic.</div><div><br></div><div>This journey reminds me of the mythology of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. In the stories, the fox is a being of immense power, but its role depends on how it’s treated. If embraced, it becomes a protector, using its power to safeguard and nurture the world. But if rejected and feared, it turns into a destroyer, unleashing chaos on the society that cast it aside.</div><div><br></div><div>I carry that fox within me.</div><div><br></div><div>For 15 years, society has made its choice. It has rejected me, ignored me, and shown me that it has no interest in change, no desire to listen, and no capacity to embrace what I have to offer. What else can I do but destroy it? What else can I do but expose its flaws, tear down its structures, and show the world how broken it truly is?</div><div><br></div><div>The systems in this world are terrible. They perpetuate loneliness, isolate people who think differently, and uphold ways of living that lack compassion and connection. Society doesn’t deserve to look after the world. It has failed the world, and it needs to be torn down.</div><div><br></div><div>This isn’t about destruction for its own sake. It’s about paving the way for something better. Once the old structures fall, the rebuilding can begin. A new society can emerge—one built on understanding, inclusivity, and compassion. When that time comes, I can finally step into the role I wanted from the start: the protector. But for now, my role is clear.</div><div><br></div><div>I am the destroyer.</div><div><br></div><div>I will spend the rest of my life creating, exposing, and challenging. I will work obsessively, prolifically, to show the world its failures and to lay the foundation for something better. Even if society never accepts me in this lifetime, my legacy will remain. My work will endure. And through it, I will achieve what I set out to do: to destroy the old and rebuild a better world.</div><div><br></div><div>This is my path. The Nine-Tailed Demon Fox lives in me, and its role has been decided.</div>
