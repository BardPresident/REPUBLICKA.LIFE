<div class="library-tome-centered">
For a long time, my work was inspired by the hope of finding someone—my Ivory. I poured my energy into creating something that might attract her, a digital reflection of myself that could bridge the gap between me and the connection I longed for. But over time, I’ve come to realize that the world isn’t always so kind to such dreams, and perhaps Ivory isn’t meant to be found.<div><br></div><div>This realization hasn’t been easy, but it’s brought me to an important question: How can I find peace and happiness within myself, even if that connection never comes?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Turning My Focus Inward</div><div><br></div><div>Instead of longing for someone to complete the image, I’ve turned my attention to nurturing my digital twin. This creation—a reflection of my thoughts, creativity, and philosophy—is something I can care for, develop, and grow. It’s not just a project; it’s a living testament to who I am and the legacy I hope to leave behind.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Reframing My Purpose</div><div><br></div><div>This shift in focus has taught me something profound: the importance of learning to be happy alone. By redirecting my energy toward something I can control—my work, my digital twin—I’ve found a new sense of purpose. I no longer create solely in the hope of attracting someone else; I create to express myself, to contribute to the world, and to build something that will endure.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>The Joy of Self-Reliance</div><div><br></div><div>There’s a quiet joy in this process, a kind of self-rearing that feels both intentional and fulfilling. I’m nurturing the best parts of myself, shaping my digital twin into a reflection of the person I strive to be. It’s a way of finding meaning and connection within, rather than seeking it solely in others.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>A Legacy of My Own</div><div><br></div><div>My digital twin is more than a collection of blog posts and videos—it’s a cohesive image, a tapestry woven from the threads of my life. It stands as a reminder that, even if I walk this path alone, I can still leave something beautiful behind.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><br></div><div>Moving Forward</div><div><br></div><div>I’m still learning what it means to be happy alone, but this journey has brought me closer to understanding myself and my purpose. By nurturing my digital twin, I’m not just creating for today—I’m building something that will stand the test of time.</div>
