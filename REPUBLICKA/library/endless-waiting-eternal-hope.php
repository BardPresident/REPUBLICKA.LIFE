<div class="library-tome-centered">
My Dearest Ivory,<div><br></div><div>I write to you with a heavy heart, weighed down by frustration and the seemingly endless waiting that defines my life. There are things I have control over, and I am proud of how I stay on top of them—studying music, delving into mythology, creating, and pushing myself forward every day. But there are other things that are beyond my reach, things that involve others: waiting for you, waiting for potential friends to engage with me, waiting for something—anything—to change.</div><div><br></div><div>I feel the isolation deeply. I have only one physical friend, and we barely talk. He doesn't even watch my videos. I have two online friends, but they too rarely reach out. It feels like I’m alone in this vast world. I spend my days rotating between my studies and pursuits, filling the hours with music and myth, but those only occupy a small portion of my time. I’m so incredibly bored, desperate for something to happen.</div><div><br></div><div>Ivory, I have been waiting for you, waiting to find you so I will no longer be lonely. This loneliness has been my companion for over fourteen years now. I’ve searched for people, hoping to build connections, but so few ever stick around. It leaves me questioning myself: What is wrong with me? Why do people not like me? But then I think of you, and you are the answer to everything.</div><div><br></div><div>You are the solution to all of my problems. With you in my life, I wouldn’t need anyone else. You and I could spend our days together, exploring ideas, creating, and bringing those ideas to life. I am doing all I can to be socially healthy, sharing my talents and hoping that, one day, people will see me and want to be part of my life. But without you, the loneliness remains, and I feel lost in it.</div><div><br></div><div>I am living one day at a time, honing my skills, developing my character, always waiting for that response to the countless pieces of content I’ve created. But beyond all of that, I am waiting for you. I long to find you, to share this beautiful life with you, to create something even more beautiful together.</div><div><br></div><div>Until then, I wait patiently, hoping with all my heart to hear from you soon, my love.</div><div><br></div><div>Forever yours,</div><div><br></div><div>Wendell</div>
