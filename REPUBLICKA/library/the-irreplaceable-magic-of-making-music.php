<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>Music has always been a uniquely human endeavor—a way to express emotions, tell stories, and create something deeply personal. Yet, with tools like Suno emerging, the landscape of music creation is shifting. Suno allows non-musicians to include music in their projects, opening up creative opportunities for many. But at what cost? The philosophy underpinning Suno, suggesting humans don’t enjoy making music, feels deeply anti-human. Should we support a tool that risks devaluing the profound experience of music-making?</div><div><br></div><div>Learning an instrument, like my own journey with the lyre, is challenging but immensely rewarding. The effort, the mistakes, the breakthroughs—it all leads to something that feels truly yours. Completing a piece of music brings unparalleled satisfaction because it’s a reflection of your emotions, creativity, and soul. AI-generated music, while functional, lacks this depth. It’s not unique to you; it’s drawn from data trained on countless others' work. It doesn’t express your emotions—it simply generates a result.</div><div><br></div><div>Suno is undeniably cool, and it holds practical value. It empowers non-musicians to include music in their productions, democratizing access to an art form often out of reach. But the philosophy behind it—the notion that humans don’t want to learn music—feels reductive and dismissive of the joy that comes from the creative process. That philosophy risks discouraging people from embracing the journey of making music, instead offering them a shortcut that lacks meaning.</div><div><br></div><div>When we support tools like Suno, we must consider the broader implications. Are we endorsing a tool that complements humanity, or are we propagating a philosophy that diminishes it? The answer matters because the philosophies we uplift shape the future of creativity and culture. Music, at its heart, is an expression of what it means to be human. To lose sight of that is to risk losing something irreplaceable.</div><div><br></div><div>AI has immense potential to enhance creativity, but it should never aim to replace the human experience of creating. Tools like Suno must be developed with care, designed to augment our artistry rather than undermine it. As creators and consumers, we have a responsibility to support technologies and philosophies that nurture humanity and its infinite potential for self-expression.</div><div><br></div><div>In a world increasingly shaped by AI, let’s ensure we remain the authors of our own stories—and the composers of our own songs.</div>
