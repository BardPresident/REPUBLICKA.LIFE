<div class="library-tome-centered">
<div>There are many subjects that ChatGPT refuses to cover, alerting me that the content violates the terms and conditions. This is unfair as many controversial subjects need proper investigation to uncover its true significance. So this time, I am writing manually instead of processing my thoughts through ChatGPT so that I can speak freely.</div><div><br></div><div>Years ago I wrote a book about legalising assisted suicide. In fact, I originally moved to Canberra to try and legalise assisted suicide. But when I got here I realised that there were no public places to voice my concern. People who suffer long term depression have no way out of their pain. Society doesn't help them in the areas that they struggle in life and as a result, they are forced to live in great distress. They dream of ending their own life but hurting oneself is not only illegal but also very difficult to do. </div><div><br></div><div>I advocate for assisted suicide to be available to those who suffer greatly over a long period of time. Everybody needs a way out of their problems, and if there are no solutions to their problems available in society, then they should have the option to escape. No one deserves to live life in extreme pain. There are easy and painless methods to escape this world, yet the government refuses the service. </div><div><br></div><div>If assisted suicide were legalised, each case would have extensive documentation as to why the individual chose to leave this world. This data would give governments the insight into why people would rather die than live. From this information, systems could be erected in society to tackle the problems that people who don't won't to live experience. This would create a feedback loop that would force us to change our systems to better accommodate those who suffer. Each assisted suicide would be evidence into the shortcomings of the government, and would ultimately cause them to change their practices and policies to avoid people utilising those services to escape their miserable lives. </div><div><br></div><div>I am a very lonely individual. I have a few online friends but they won't speak to me every day. I go without human contact for very long periods and very few people ever engage with my work. I have spent the last fifteen years searching for friends and I have been unable to find a single person who will communicate with me on a near daily basis. This absence of social relationships in my life makes me feel that life isn't worth living. Who in their right mind would ever choose to live a life without friends? The government institutionalised me five times but they never helped me find meaningful connections. They medicated me but they never assisted me to solve my problems and connect with others. </div><div><br></div><div>I have a dog now and she makes me want to live to care for her. But if assisted suicide were legalised, then I would find a good home for her and then do it. There is no hope in my life. I have spent thirteen years reaching out on the internet searching for friends. Although I met a few people doing this, I have been unable to find people to regularly be apart of my life. After fifteen years of trying to find friends and failing, what does that signal for my future? More of the same. People are not discovering my content and they haven't for thirteen years. The chances that tomorrow will be any different is slim to none. Thus, the government forces me to live a life of suffering, only ever knowing loneliness. </div><div><br></div><div>I don't want to live because I have no social life and this has been the case ever since my ex-wife left me. What is the point of living if all you ever do is suffer as a result of your circumstances? It is cruel to force someone to live a life of suffering. Yet our governments do that every day.</div><div><br></div><div>I don't want to encourage people to commit assisted suicide. But I do want to encourage governments to resolve the problems that make people want to die. Suicide isn't even on their radar. Suicide in society is seen as a selfish and immoral act. But how is it moral to allow people who suffer intensely to continue their miserable existence? I want a society where no one commits suicide, but that society would help people who are struggling with life. How can society illegalise the act but not assist people to overcome? It is a contradiction in the way the government is run. </div><div><br></div><div>I advocate for assisted suicide to be legalised. The data that such cases would provide to us would be integral to creating systems that prevent it for the future. I want to live in a society that cares about people and helps them through their problems. But that can't happen if we don't understand how to guide people to overcome their turmoil or what causes their despair. </div><div><br></div><div>I want to live in a society that cares for its people. Legalising assisted suicide is the first step to accomplishing this. From there we can learn how to accommodate those people who are fed up with life, providing them what they need to reach fulfilment, like helping me find friends who engage with my ideas. Because if I had friends then I would have a perfect life. I would not want to leave this world if I shared real connection with others. </div><div><br></div><div>When I was homeless I protested in front of ACT Housing holding a sign that stated, "Help Your People OR Legalise Assisted Suicide". But it is obvious that the government won't help its people without incentives such as failing at saving a life. Therefore, my philosophy has changed and is now just "Legalise Assisted Suicide" because that act will give governments the data to understand why people would want to leave this world prematurely.</div><div><br></div><div>Give me the opportunity to be the first to leave this world by legalising assisted suicide. Or instead you could just be my friend and that would provide me with a perfect life where the last thing I would ever want is to die.</div>
