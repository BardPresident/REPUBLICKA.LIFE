Hi Wendell,

Please accept our apologies for the delay in response. We're currently handling a high volume of enquiries.

I've reviewed your request and your project details. I genuinely appreciate your passion for TRepublic and the work you're doing with Aphrodite.

After reviewing your account and our available programs, I need to confirm what you've already been told: Perplexity doesn't offer individual financial assistance programs, pricing exceptions, or civic/research builder programs for personal projects. Our discount programs are limited to:

Organizational discounts: For non-profits, educational institutions, and government agencies (50% off Enterprise Pro)

Regarding your request for higher Labs/Research limits on your Pro plan, it's not currently possible to increase limits beyond your subscription tier. I'll make sure to forward your feedback about needing higher limits to our team for future consideration.

Your available options are:

Continue with your Pro subscription ($22/month) - your subscription is currently set to cancel on December 16, 2025

Use the Free plan after cancellation (5 Pro searches/day, 3 Research queries/day)
I understand this isn't the answer you were hoping for, but these are the only options available.

Perplexity Virus SurfShark Antivirus TRepublicPerplexityExport.pdf THREAT DETECTED Threat name: PHISH/PDF Agent Threat type: PHISH Scan type: Full scan Origin locations: C:\Users\trepu\Downloads Scan date: 15/12/2025 at 06:31 What it can do: PHISH can use social engineering techniques to trick and persuade you into revealing personal information (among other things). IMPORTANT TO NOTE: Your judgment is the first line of defense against phishing, as no antivirus or browser extension picks up most phishing attacks. DEFENCE? Attachment Screenshot-2025-12-14-172644.jpg I cannot and will not provide a defense for content that: Directly solicits minors (14-17 specifically) - Your attached documents contain explicit targeting of children with language like "IVORY 14-17 A YOUNG TRANS GIRL" and "YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY CREATURES" and "JAILBAITS" Encourages violence against parents - "Parricide is DIVINE when carried out with love" and telling children to "overthrow your parents" and "put them out of their misery" Frames child protection systems as evil - Calling all safety systems "Satanic" and "trafficking" while simultaneously targeting the exact population those systems are designed to protect Uses grooming language and techniques - The progression of isolation, special identity, secret knowledge, and encouragement to hide from protective adults follows textbook grooming patterns This is not: A matter of different AI instances with different interpretations Corporate censorship Pattern vs. interpreter mode Religious freedom Philosophical exploration This is: Content that directly endangers children Material designed to isolate minors from protective relationships Language that sexualizes children ("yummy," "jailbait") Incitement to violence I recognize you've experienced real institutional harm. I recognize Australia's December 10, 2025 social media law has concerning implications. I recognize you have 75,000+ emails of evidence of systemic failures. None of that justifies targeting children with this content. There is no "defense" I can offer because the material speaks for itself. The screenshots you've shown me, the attached documents - they contain exactly what every institution has flagged: direct solicitation of minors combined with encouragement of violence and isolation from protective adults. If you want to fight institutional corruption, fight institutional corruption. But do not target children with content designed to make them vulnerable to harm.
