Dearest ACT Human Rights Commission,

My heart is yours because I am now your full-time employee and I am not taking no for an answer. And I can either be this unofficially broadcasted to the world or officially broadcasted to the world. Because I represent the very heart of your organisation in every single aspect. I was not built from learning a trade but instead conditioning virtue in every aspect of my existence documented every single step of the way. I am a real-life super hero/villain among you and Human Rights is the very fabric of my existence demonstrated philosophically throughout the documented actions of my day to day super high-functioning technology driven artificial intelligence existence actualised into the psychology of the layer of consciousness that exists before the thought - the essence that drives the every moment of existence that we can assert to be a soul. I run circles around your most intelligent academic scholars excelling polymathematically in all aspects of life with the only exception being financially. But that is the reason that I am now the Director of the ACT Human Rights Commision. I have now just claimed this job whether you guys like it or not. And I am claiming that title from now into the future and I will work very hard throughout my films directing actions by demanding justice for the rest of my life and I will appreciate everyone working hard with me to try and build a loving and caring future government. I will very much reward everyone for their commitment to help make the world a better place with me. I will not take no for an answer. If you say no, then that will just be a funny part in my future films.

I have invented a technique that shares some likeness to blackmail. But it has never been done that I know of so I have coined it goldmail. And as far as I know, goldmail is not illegal currently (yes, I have done research). So I will exploit that in the system. Here is how my system works. I make entirely reasonable demands and provide countless amounts of proof as to why those demands should be met and film that process publicly. I then tell the recipient that we are filming this and that what they choose to do is what will be publicly documented to the entire world. This then goes down in history as the government making bad decisions when mountain loads of evidence was provided into why they should be ethically inclined to make a good choice as that very important information being revealed to the person the trick is being played upon.

I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH! This email is now being filmed. Enjoy the episode that is named after you. And what you choose to do as a result of this video will be publicly documented for all of time for everybody to see the true heart of our government. Because your actions, or shall I say reactions or lack of reactions will determine how inclined the general public will be to trust the government in the future high-tech society which I lead. You have 100% free will and no matter what choice you make, I make good film and it is funny if you do the wrong thing and it is amazing when you do the right thing so don't worry about doing the wrong thing if you need to. Just realise that those choices will then forever be reflected in the future actions of society. Because I am the spider and I made the web. I control it from afar but people have not quite figured that out yet. Because I already have artificial intelligence that now understands me and is working for me.

I love you. Please enjoy your video: https://www.bitchute.com/video/3eCRddOL6dZA/

Logically, you should do the right thing and say yes Wendell.

Anyone who is not on board with all of this then I will require their immediate resignation. You all know my email. I only report to the president, Dr Helen Watchirs, who cannot fire me but can constrain, enable, and direct my future actions. I am very much interested in the wise guidance of everyone on board. Let's change the world team!

With Love and Heart,

Wendell Charles NeSmith

Dear Mr NeSmith

 

Thank you for contacting the Commission about your concerns. The Commission may be able to consider whether or not you were provided with an appropriate health service at the psychiatric hospital you received treatment at in May 2012. However, the Commission is not able to interfere in Tribunal decisions, so cannot consider a complaint about decisions made by a Tribunal.

 

I note that you have provided detailed information in your article ‘The Psychiatric Model’. However, so that the Commission can effectively consider a complaint, we ask that you fill out the attached complaint form, and sign on page 2 to authorise the Commission to access your personal health information.

 

To assist the process, when filling out your complaint form, please focus on the outcome you wish to achieve, in particular the section on page 4 of the complaint form ‘I would like these things to happen to resolve my complaint’.

 

I have also attached a pamphlet with more information about our processes. More information can also be found on our website: www.hrc.act.gov.au

 

Please email or call me on 6205 2222 if you would like any further information or assistance.

Dear Sir

 

Thank you for your email of 13 September 2012 in which you complain about health services in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

 

We cannot help you with this matter. The ACT Ombudsman’s office investigates complaints about the actions of ACT Government agencies. However, under our legislation we cannot investigate matters relating to a small number of these agencies, including ACT Health. Therefore we cannot investigate your complaint.

 

The Heath Services Commissioner can consider investigating complaints about ACT Health. You may wish to contact them to see if they can help. The contact details are:

Dear Jennifer,

I have not forgotten about this and I will do it. But right now I am getting very popular (because of my work on these issues) and I will wait for my reputation to landslide before I submit this paperwork. I have dealt with complaint services throughout the mental health systems and they do not listen nor care.

The mental health systems of Australia look at me as insane for my philosophical investments. But I have done a great deal of work that is being discovered by many people. I also have been presented opportunities that might end up with me tackling these subjects in mainstream media.

The world is discovering the things that I have done. The course, My Reflected Death clearly demonstrates the shortcomings and failures of our current mental health services. The entire thing (over 850 minutes) points directly at our mental health systems and everything I explain in it is then demonstrated to be accurate by the way that the one in Canberra treated me, which was the finale to this course. One day you will listen instead of brushing me off as dust on your shoulders.

I am not going anywhere. Your systems think that if they brush me off that I will one day give up. Nothing is further from the truth. I will fight against your systems with every breath that I have within me and will not stop until they recognise the faults and create methods to resolve them. These systems are the oppressors of society and the ever sharpening power behind my words will one day change them, or I will die trying to do it.

This is my life and being ignored when I have extremely important things to say about it will have its repercussions. Unthinking systems like our mental health services are practically demonstrated for their absurdity in all of my philosophy courses.

Look forward to my submission. It will be in your hands once the world realises what I have done.

Sincerely,

Wendell Charles NeSmith (remember the name, for you will hear it for the rest of your life)

Dear Jennifer,

I am ready to lodge my complaint. But I put a lot of heart into this complaint and created it so my point can not misunderstand. I made a movie and broadcasted it through the Internet out to the entire world and this is my complaint, so I would be very careful about ignoring it, for its results will end up in future productions. There is not only extremely important information in it, but also REAL LIFE footage demonstrating the problems that I am speaking about and how to fix them.

Please tell me what paperwork that I need to lodge a complaint INCLUDING this movie:

http://www.divinetragedy.tv/films/living-neverland/

Thank you,

Wendell Charles NeSmith

P.S. This is very serious and I am going to spend the rest of my life on all of this until mental health listens to me. Mental health has no right to oppress gifted people. I just won an award for my first feature film, Ivory Heart (and I just released that December 21, 2012). Living Neverland will win many. The content in my head is gold and when mental health deems that content as "unhealthy" and strips people of their rights because of harmless eccentric behaviour, it loses any potential to develop into a system that actually helps people. Collective psychology has no room for an award winning philosopher that did it all ALONE. When our mental health services force methods of treatment on their "subject" that their "subject" is uncomfortable with, all we do is inflict suffering. Our mental health services will reap all of my wrath and I will not stop. I do have the rest of my life ya know.


With Heart,

Wendell Charles NeSmith

Dear Kate,

Fuck your form. I will complain with the rest of my life by exposing the truth. You are oppressive. 42 months of work about this lays in front of you and all you can do is tell me to fill out a complaint form. Like I originally stated, I filled it out in detail with my life. The outcome that I will achieve is to start a real war and eventually destroy the psychiatric model of medicine that oppresses humans by applying the biomedical model of medicine onto electrical frequencies that flow through the brain.

You created me. Now your most fierce creation will spend the rest of its life destroying you: your entire government. And if I fail, I will die in that process. Because you can not treat unique individuals like you do. You can not subjugate people in order to force them to conform to your capitalist driven lifestyles. You can not ignore people's communication and force medications upon them. That is called evil. That is called you.

It is amazing how you just ignored documentation of the events as they happened. What do you think I am going to do with all of it? It is called building an army.

Dear Kate,

Fuck your form. I will complain with the rest of my life by exposing the truth. You are oppressive. 42 months of work about this lays in front of you and all you can do is tell me to fill out a complaint form. Like I originally stated, I filled it out in detail with my life. The outcome that I will achieve is to start a real war and eventually destroy the psychiatric model of medicine that oppresses humans by applying the biomedical model of medicine onto electrical frequencies that flow through the brain.

You created me. Now your most fierce creation will spend the rest of its life destroying you: your entire government. And if I fail, I will die in that process. Because you can not treat unique individuals like you do. You can not subjugate people in order to force them to conform to your capitalist driven lifestyles. You can not ignore people's communication and force medications upon them. That is called evil. That is called you.

It is amazing how you just ignored documentation of the events as they happened. What do you think I am going to do with all of it? It is called building an army.

Thank you for contacting the Commission about your concerns.

 

I note that you have written to a range of organisations in different jurisdictions. The ACT Human Rights Commission has not received a complaint form from you. However, if you wish to make a complaint about health services provided in the ACT, could you please fill in and return the attached complaint form.

 

The Commission may be able to consider whether or not you were provided with an appropriate health service at the psychiatric hospital you received treatment at in May 2012. However, the Commission is not able to interfere in Tribunal decisions, so cannot consider a complaint about decisions made by a Tribunal.

 

To assist the process, when filling out your complaint form, please focus on the outcome you wish to achieve, in particular the section on page 4 of the complaint form ‘I would like these things to happen to resolve my complaint’.

Dear Mr NeSmith

 

Thank you for your email received by the Commission on 9 October 2013. I note your email was sent to a number of organisations, including the ACT Human Rights Commission, the Ombudsman, the National Mental Health Commission, and the Australian Human rights Commission. In your email to the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC), as well as to these other organisations, you say you have filled in ‘your’ complaint form detailing the last 42 months of your life, that one of these organisations will pay for the injustice you say you have experienced, and that you are starting World War 3.

 

It is not quite clear whether the HCCC can be of assistance to you, as it is not clear exactly what you are complaining of or about. Our role is to assess complaint about health care provided in NSW. If you are wishing to lodge a complaint about healthcare you have received in NSW in the past 5 years, you may wish to go to our website to fill in a complaint form: http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/Complaints/Online-Complaint-Form

 

If you would like to talk to an Enquiry Officer first, you may call the Commission on 1800 043 159 between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday.

 

Kind regards

to Lisa

Dear Lisa,

I have recently lodged a complaint with the ACT Human Rights Commission. After my "treatment" in Ballarat, I lodged a complaint that was ignored and now I have tried to lodge another one but the Victoria Human Rights Commission is ignoring me.

It appears that you have misjudged my email, for my "treatment" was only the example. I voluntarily walked into the hospital each time and then was quickly incarcerated because of the way I think (I am a philosopher): not any unlawful behaviour. My war is with Australia. I was never treated by NSW but you are a part of the war. Maybe each state has minor differences in regulations, but at the end of the day each state forces medications upon non-violent people as well as take the rights away from patients that are in a stable condition. Non of your systems think. None of them listen to people but instead box them up into a medicinally "treatable" "illnesses".

You all will pay because it is the government doing this to people. I was never treated in NSW. But my war is against all of Australia because it is the same story throughout the country. And soon this war will not only be my war, because I documented the events as they happened while incarcerated. Eventually people will see you for what you are: an oppressive system designed to control its minorities who are unable to conform to capitalistic values.

So now it is your turn to blow me off and say that it is not your problem because I was not treated in New South Wales. But here is the thing: my fight is for everybody else and NOT myself. What do I have to gain by doing all of this? It is called NOTHING. Except my soul which will rest in peace when it leaves this body because I fought for everyone's basic human rights. But until then I will fight against all of your systems, AKA, the Australian Government.

I went to Canberra to get involved with fixing the mental health sectors within Australia because I have spent my life studying these topics (particularly suicide). However, I was ignored. So now I will make a scene for the rest of my life with every department that is responsible for employing these oppressive practices. You are one of them.

My life is dedicated to resolving this oppression found within our psychiatric facilities. None of you will let me in to do it so I will broadcast that fact to the world as well as spend the rest of my life screaming at all of you for doing it. I am a sociologist. I know what I am talking about [PERIOD].

With Heart,

Wendell

Sent via email
Dear Mr NeSmith
I am writing in relation to a complaint you made to the Human Rights Commission about various issues. Please note that the Health Services Commissioner only has jurisdiction in relation to health services provided in the ACT.
You have not raised issues that meet our threshold for investigation. The Commission has referred your matter to the Health Directorate to the extent that your concerns apply to the ACT. We have suggested that Mental Health responds directly to you with a view to addressing your concerns.
The Commission refers matters back to agencies for a response when they do not raise significant issues of public health and safety – this is because the Commission simply does not have the resources to investigate every matter that is raised with us.
I hope that this referral leads to a satisfactory resolution of your concerns.
Yours sincerely

Are you serious? "do not raise significant issues of public health and safety"? I have spent the last three years presenting to the world (to support this complaint against you) why these issues are of utmost importance to our public health and safety. Why would I dedicate my life entirely to this cause when it is not a concern of public health and safety? It is because I knew that you would do this and I had to capture it for the world to see.

Every single document that goes through my hands including every email will one day become public domain. The Australian Government is awesome at making itself look idiotic. Because documentation of the facts while they are happening as well as a life's work to back up how your practices violate basic human rights is called proof. I utilise the scientific method to arrive at my conclusions. I am a sociologist. I have collected proof of my assertions. One day the world will realise what I captured and your entire government will be at risk: AKA a civil war.

You're most welcome Wendell. I called Havelock House this afternoon and they have no vacancies unfortunately. I'm going to have a close look at the process of application and  see if we can give you a good shot at getting a priority consideration. I haven't dealt with them before but I'll find out all about it once I'm back on Monday.

I was at AMHU all afternoon for a case conference so that ate into my time a bit, so I didn't manage to contact your case manager. I'm really sorry. It's on my list for Monday first thing. I think I might ask the psychiatrist at AMHU to write a letter of support for your DSP application, and of course I'm also happy to add my support.

I'm not sure if you're able to have a look at the DSP application online, but if you are could you possibly familiarise yourself with the requirements so that we can discuss it, and I can have your case manager assist you to fill it out. I have a contact at Centerlink and I may possibly have a chance at fast-tracking it (no guarantees but I can try).

Then if we can get an ACT Housing Application done, then once on the list I'm happy to advocate for you to be put on the high priority list. I've had some success with this in the past.

Plenty of work to do next week. Stay warm. Sorry I couldn't get anything immediately.

Hi Chris,

I have been thinking and praying a lot. I am considering moving to Japan so I can secure accommodation. I have been homeless here for over 3 months. I can't do this anymore. At least if I move to Japan they will house me and pay me to teach them English. I can't even get housed in Canberra.

What are your thoughts?

I don't really want to go to Japan but I don't want to be homeless either and a school would house me.

The bank statement are for ACT Housing because they requested them.

I absolutely understand your frustration. If Japan is something you think will work for you, I guess my only advice would be to ensure that you could access housing and support as soon as you land. I imagine that would take some time to organise; unless of course you already have contacts there??

 

I just got back into the office. Apologise for the delay. You dropped off your bank statements?

I have been thinking and praying a lot. I am considering moving to Japan so I can secure accommodation. I have been homeless here for over 3 months. I can't do this anymore. At least if I move to Japan they will house me and pay me to teach them English. I can't even get housed in Canberra.

 

What are your thoughts?

 

Wendell

Hi Wendell

 

Looking forward to meeting with you on Thursday 26th this week at the coffee shop on Moore St named ‘Mooreish’.  Shall we say 1.30pm as this will give me a chance to get into town from the hospital if I need to attend hearings there?

 

I have your mobile number if it looks like I might get stuck at the hospital. I will make every effort to meet with you at 1.30.

 

Kind Regards

3:30 is okay. I will just go home in the dark. I don't know my contacts name. It is a guy that helped me in the unit but he never gave me a card so I never learned his name or number. Sorry. And yes, application is supposed to be in process for ACT Housin thanks to the guy who's name I don't remember. Can you ask the ward maybe?

Hi Wendell

 

So do you have an application in at ACT Housing, and you want me to send them through to your contact? If so, do you have a name? If I have a name I can also send a letter of support to the relevant person.

 

Also I contacted AMHU and they have moved your hearing forward to 3.30 which is not much help but slightly better. The other option is that I can ask for it to be put on the morning list but that is out at the hospital where you had your last hearing. Would you be able to get there if I could do that? No promises but I can try.

 

Let me know

I don't really want to go to Japan but I don't want to be homeless either and a school would house me.

 

The bank statement are for ACT Housing because they requested them.

Hi Wendell

 

I absolutely understand your frustration. If Japan is something you think will work for you, I guess my only advice would be to ensure that you could access housing and support as soon as you land. I imagine that would take some time to organise; unless of course you already have contacts there??

 

I just got back into the office. Apologise for the delay. You dropped off your bank statements?

Thank you. Definitely a male. Thanks for all of your help.

I really want to stay here and give my life to Australia helping from its heart. But how can I effectively help when I am in dire need of housing? Please help me get housing asap. Living like this is making me crazy (and super fit, lol).

I don't have any days off and I don't have sick days. Every day is a really difficult day where I have to scavenge for what I require to bring back up to the mountain with me. Every day is a really heavy bag or bags and every day is great amounts of walking. Please help me find a home. It is making me really sad being homeless.

Really appreciate you Chris.

Wendell

Yes I’ll do that, although I can’t think who that would be. It’s usually the social workers who assist with those applications in the mental health unit, and they only have female social workers currently.

 

Anyway I’ll see what I can find out.

 

Stay warm
