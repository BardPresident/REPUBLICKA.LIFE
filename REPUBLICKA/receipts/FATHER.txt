Dearest Father,

This email will be to outline some of the major actions in your life that changed it and how those actions affected those close to you. I will build your case from its foundations to assess whether or not you are what you claim to be. I will do my best to not throw any aggressive statements at you, but merely recap on my observations of your life while I have existed in it and what you have made it for both yourself and those around you.

I will begin with the day mother stated the clear observation that you are like your Father. You had so much resentment built up against him that these words became unacceptable to you. Instead of attempting to organise your thoughts about how and why she would say that, you stomped out of the house only to return to collect your belongings (and falling down getting severely hurt). That was the day you left your manhood by rejecting those closest in your life.

You then proceeded to split up the family by expressing resentful feelings to your children about their mother. You became isolated and this made you lonely to quickly find a woman to fill the hole that you just bombed. You bribed your sons to stay with you and found multiple lies on the Internet. You tore apart a family and brought them into an unstable household. You rejected three children which you recently adopted. You tried to fill your loneliness by hanging out with your students.

Eventually you found "true love" on the Internet and travelled to the other side of the world to fill it. You fortunately found employment and were quickly married to obtain a permanent residence. Shortly after you took advantage of an unfortunate son who was seeking asylum from a school in which he was regularly beat up at. You flew him away from his family (ruining their relationships) and then held that ticket over his head even to this day. You oppressed his freedom searching soul refusing his attendance at parties and then grounded him for a month because he arrived home late because of a situation beyond his control (he was unable to do the dishes within the time you allocated). This caused him to snap and he walked out on you into homelessness (and has never returned to a stable home life since). You felt no remorse and were too proud to apologise or even attempt resolution.

After this you occasionally invited him over for awkward meals. Not too long after you decided to again travel around the world and this time bring you new bride with you. She made her decisions but this ultimately caused her to build the Great Wall of China of resentment against you. You abandoned your child who you brought into this horrible country and left him with a girlfriend and family that did not even like him. Ever since then he has been alone with a family on the other side of the globe who no longer wanted him as a result of a decision he made in childhood to seek refuge from a really bad school, all of this which you were always aware of.

The day I left America for the first time I told mother that if she died then I could rest peacefully because I knew that she would be okay. She is a child of God and will receive many rewards in heaven, even though she has ignorantly stated many hurtful words against me. I am very proud of my Mother. I told her before I got on that plane the first time that I did not feel the same about you. I had recently set up my Mother with a very good man (although unnecessarily aggressive). I know personalities and I knew that they would grow together and help refine each other until the day they died. I set up my Mother to heal and I knew that she would. And I was right. But you were always a different story because you are destructive with both your own and other's emotions.

I found a family that was not emotionally good either. So I needed to stay with them to try and help, even though I always knew that they did not like me. I hoped for Gennah and I to become close, but she only became more distant the longer we were together. Eventually she left me and told all of my inherited friends to no longer speak to me, and they obeyed. After this I have come to you countless times attempting to form a relationship but you always turn emotions nasty. You say words that have no basis but are only crafted to cut: like an emotional response that has not had time to evolve into the truth. And you never display any remorse for those words but instead stick by them.

During this time you and Melissa desired children to fill the hole that you both had in your hearts. You were very aware of adoption procedures because you had already been through them with the ones you rejected. Effort on your own children was out of the question because they were the problem and not you. So one child became two and then Melissa realised that it was not children that would fill the void in her life, but removing you from it. Her best coping mechanism was to be aggressive towards you when she is with you. You knew this before your adoptions but thought it wiser to create another broken home: having children are never methods to resolve conflict. And sure enough shortly after your second and another trip around the world, you again leave your family to find greener pastures without them.

You never showed any care about my homelessness problem. Australia creates its homeless population. I am unable to afford bond so I can never rent. I am unable to fly back to the USA because I can not afford it. And if I could afford bond then it would not be much of a different story because Australians are racist against Americans. I have applied for over 11,000 jobs here but am rejected 1. because I am American and 2. because I am homeless (despite my brilliance for technology demonstrated while homeless every single day). I have obtained every job I was after in America. I live a life of day to day suffering, always being moved on. I end up spending all of my money to repair/replace equipment and food, because 15-30 kilometres a day of walking requires energy. I have no transport and always end up walking on extremely dangerous streets because I have no other choice. Most of the time I end up in the wilderness because food and maintenance of equipment takes precedence over a spot to put my tent at a caravan park. This means I often go without showers and am constantly battling short and long term affects of parasites such as ticks and leeches and their wounds.

After I get caught for camping in the wilderness I am then moved on because that is illegal (it is illegal no matter what I do when I have no money). I always explain my situation and they always agree that society has fucked me over, but they tell me it is not their problem and force me to walk yet again until I am able to find another spot to wait for the same thing to happen. I have secretly recorded some of these conversations (with video) and they are really sad.

Throughout these journeys I have come to you requesting to borrow money twice  (I was in very bad situations) 1. $30 2. $60-100. Both times I could repay within a week with 25% interest. Both times you highly insulted my character and refused. The second time I caught on camera in a huge documentary that will soon get very popular. Because Independence Year 4 Kidz teaches children how to rebel against their parents: against you. And it relaunches open source television, education, and most importantly, launches the open source republic which I was not asking to implement. I am starting a war. I am starting a revolution.

In addition, the second time, I opened up to you about what I was doing. Living on the streets for so long led me to many stories about child molestation occurring within secret societies in our nation's capital: Canberra. I kept my intentions a secret until I had proof (which over time I learned of the government's  involvement, at least with their cover ups) and when I advised you about those terrible atrocities, you wrote me off as crazy without further investigation, just like most of the other brainwashed adults do. I captured your arrogance and ignorance on film.

I have much more to say about this topic, but for now I have said enough. I previously advised you that I was the first step in your judgement, in which you responded with cruelty and malice. I stick by those words and tell you clearly that you are no child of God and your soul is headed straight for Hell. But you will never humble your vision enough to see the truth because you are just like your Father.

With Hope,

You are no Father of mine, or anyone else for that matter.

"WOMB THAT CARRIED YOU"

My very sick and sinful son

Wendell. You my son are a very sick individual which I abhor but love at the same time. As a child you were my heart and joy, yet you have allowed demons within your mind and soul of which I detest. I give my life to help and penetrate as many children with the confidence and joy of living a life of giving back to Jesus and others just a bit of all He has given to us. You on the other hand seek to destroy all that My heart stands for. My prayer is that if the pedophile in you touched or touches one of God's precious children you will be shot dead in you tracks by some well meaning caring person.

You are from my being, I carried you in my womb.  At this point I abhor and detest it. .you have made me sick and want to vomit.  I protected you as a child from sick people as yourself,  and now I am powerless to protect the other children you prey upon.  I would rather hear of your death than a child's life ruined by your insanity. 

When you are ready to repent and return to our saviour I will communicate with you. If I hear of you touching one of God's sacred children I will kill you personally if I get a chance. I detest you my son of my womb and at this point regret the day I conceived you. 

Don't waste your time writing me unless it is repentance because I will not waste a second of my life reading something a pediphile writes. I will continue to pray for you but continue to pray for your death if you touch one of God's precious innocent creations. 
Signed,
The womb that carried you,

Perfect! Thank you Mother! God always provides! It really means a lot to me. It gave me an awesome chapter that proves all my assertions correct (yet again). I will be publishing this book (based on my award winning film) and it is already going viral. Thank you for the chapter contribution. 3 more to go.

I appreciate what little childhood you all gave me. I wish you well in your future endeavours. I am called to do all of this but you all rejected me for that very fact. I will pray for your souls.
