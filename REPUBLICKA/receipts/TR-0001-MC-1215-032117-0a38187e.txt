Important info for you

Your PDF bill is the actual invoice showing your bill amount and due dates for payment. View it by clicking the "Download bill" button above. To protect your personal information, Vodafone recommends that you clear your internet browser history once the bill has fully downloaded.

Your bill contains your minimum monthly charge in advance. It may show extra charges if you exceed your plan allowances or use services not included in your plan within the previous billing period. If you have changed your plan or have upgraded, your bill should be pretty straightforward - you'll see a charge for the new plan you've moved to for the month ahead as well as the first instalment if you got a new device on a Monthly Payment Plan.
