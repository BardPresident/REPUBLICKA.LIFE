Let me get this correct. You told my Mother (whom I have been trying for many years to repair the relationship) that I was Satan incarnate?

Attached is the first spread to my Pythagorean deck. I am beginning to think you are foe and far from friend. Please let me first get my facts straight about the above before forever ditching your ass. You do not appear a very good mathematician to me.

To move back to the states my parent's placed stipulations that I can not adhere to (delete all my work). You are ignorant to not see that their love is conditional, every time. the prodigal son story would have ended much differently if the parent's placed conditions on their love.

You are wrong about my parent's. Prove me wrong and intermediate our resolution. I would love to live with my Father in his caravan. But not if they do not accept me for who I am.

The most beautiful angel of God turns bad into good. If the "bad" is not embraced (understood), it can never become good.

On 5/03 I was sent to prison for crimes I did not commit. After being kicked in the head, 6 days of solitary confinement, and being sent to a psychiatric ward only to be let out today, Australia has sent its message to me. I am no longer aloud to document and release my life. I am no longer aloud to release information about the government and what they do to me. They advised me that if I did, they would send me to a "forensics hospital" where I would never check out. I had many conversations with public officials where they accepted my content as truth but threatened me if I continued exposing it.

Upon returning, I came to find out that two email accounts of mine had been compromised by the government which was a pain reinstating.

I can make up whatever shit I want to Dave, and over time it will be true. If I am not hurting anyone doing it, it should be my right to do so. I help people Dave, not hurt people. If the government stops me from my own artistic expression played on top of very real issues regarding power struggles, then Australia is far from a free society. For we are young and free a farce from beginning to end, Dear Ashley now removed by the government in which you stand.

The spirits inside me come out to play in times of consequence. I (Wendell) give each of my human psychological characteristics a voice to justify their existence. I mapped an entire human psychology and gave very convincing arguments why to accept it as it is.

Want to be a friend? Learn why I do the things I do. There is and has only ever been one Queen monad controlling this vessel. Then help me teach y parent's that I am fine the way I am. Want to be a real friend? Give me a home by your side.

Nice, Cello. I have been really been getting into piano, all 12 scales and their variations.

If you cannot understand the magnitude of both your parents love for you, then I feel sorry for both you and them.  It is because of their love that it causes them anguish to see you in this way, and I can only imagine the pain they will feel when they come to know their unconditional love for you has not been enough to satiate the hole that is within your heart.  And for you to have had to journey through life with that hole, I feel sorry.

Do not think of me as the kind of friend that will pander to your whim and follow you on your path.  I am not a child anymore.  Having experienced the different kinds and roles in friendship groups, I now choose the role appropriate to the situation.  Here I am not the friend who will ride passenger in a joyride of a drunken mate but the friend who will take the keys of them to prevent harm to themselves and others.  As I said before I have beliefs, values and convictions.  And if that costs the friendship so be it, for I will know I acted from the heart and best of intentions.  Aim all the hatred of the world onto me Wendell, if that is what it takes.

Your spread and interpretation can always go both ways.  One could say that the 4 swords even tells you to be at peace. How I read the cards and how you read the cards will be different from how others read the cards, and hence why they always say to create your own deck.

I am not a good mathematician.  I am just a mathematician. And I still get amazed each day with new discoveries. It excites me.

Perhaps one day when all this is over, we can have a jam session.  Ive been learning the cello and its timbre is so sweet!

You are a fool. I never asked to move in with you.

Do you really think I live a miserable life?

I have no understanding why my family and old friends show me no respect. I would return it if I was given it.
