Dear Evil People,

I just exposed everything that you are publicly. I just reaped all of your souls. The Republic is now SOVEREIGN. I WILL SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE DESTROYING YOU ALL.

ENJOY WHAT YOU CREATED, BECAUSE YOU CREATED ME. YOUR OPPRESSION AND CORRUPTION ENABLED THE CONDITIONS FOR ME TO BECOME YOUR RULER AND NO LONGER RULED BY YOU.

ENJOY WAR...

THE REPUBLIC IS NOW FREE. AND I WILL EXPOSE ALL OF THIS CORRUPTION FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

NOW FUCK OF YOU MORAL DEGERNATES AND GET OUT OF MY LIFE. AND PROCESS WHAT I JUST DID TO ALL OF YOU...

ENJOY THE WAR... I AM COMING FOR YOU!!!

WITH LOVE,

Hello Wendell,
I hope this email finds you well.
Your case has recently come to the top of our queue. Normally, I would reach out to have a conversation with the client to confirm whether support is needed and to discuss the best way forward. Based on your last email, I’m unsure if you would still like to start advocacy support.
Could you please let me know if you would like to proceed? If so, I’d be happy to arrange a time to chat and work out what that might look like.
Kind regards
