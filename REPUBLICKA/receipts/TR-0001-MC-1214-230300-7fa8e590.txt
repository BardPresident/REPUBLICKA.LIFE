All my iPhone5 cables died and I will not have money to get another until Saturday, and I have to go to Lismore to get one. My final episode is on my phone and the cops want to indefinitely confiscate my phone. Just letting you both know I will be out of contact.

Will you still be checking emails / do you have access to public email?
 
I am hoping to speak to my criminal lawyer contact tomorrow morning Sydney time -- should that be a successful conversation, how should he best get in touch with you?

I managed to get another charge by cutting up some dead cables. I am now working charge by charge.

The cops really have fucked me over. They damaged a fair amount of my equipment. They also cut me off from my main power source and any ability to receive assistance like Internet from the community centre. Their restraining order cut 2 sides of the street off: a main portion of the very small town. They knew what they were doing. So if I have no charge, I have no power. In addition, The restraining order cuts me off from the bus stop. I am legally only allowed down 1/3 streets or I have broken the restraining order.

So this enabled them to know where I come from. I am terrorised by them regularly and in public. I am afraid to go to town in fear of terrorism or arrest for another framed incident. It is really sad how I am unable to obtain any respite. Its going down in history.

Once I get this documentary sorted out and pass on the rest of my excess belongings to those who want them, as well as give my chicken away, I require the authorities to incarsarate me until the hearing and/or trial is complete. I can not live like this. I am a human and all of my rights are now violated on a day to day basis for obeying orders. Please arrange this and/or help me arrange this. If I am in their possession, they will be unable to pin crap on me that I did not do. Unjust defamation of character anyone? Who is trying to instill fear?

If I have no phone and/or power, I am uncontactable. And the police very much want to take my phone from me indefinitely.
