Hi Wendy,

Thank you so much for your kind words. They really mean a lot to me. Your heart is so beautiful. I don't get a lot of positive feedback doing what I do. Everybody is so brainwashed and it is hard to get them to budge on anything. Your words of encouragement will help me write more positively in my book I am currently writing. Thank you.

i would love to hear what book are you currently working on? What is it about? I dont know why you get soooo much hate from other people. Some people dont understand you and others are just nasty. people at school are nasty to me too and my parents dont understand me so i think i know how you feel. Its like the system is designed to lift up bad people while putting down good people.

You are very wise to see these things Wendy. Society is definitely geared to lift up the bad people and put down the good - exactly as you said it. My book is, in a way, sinister. It is insulting the reader and every human in the world. But the book is declared as not written for humans so it tells people not not to read it so if they read it then they would be enduring my punishment willingingly after I said from the beginning that it wasn't written for humans. I have thrown around five or six book names but have not settled on anything yet. To be honest, I have not settled on the book at all. Even though I am already 25% finished with it, I am assessing its potential value. I think it is fine but I need to take it slow and look back for a little bit.

Peers at school can be nasty. I don't like how our society encourages that atmosphere. If ours schools actually cared then they would teach subjects that the student cares about most in life. The schools should be tailored to the student.

My parents don't understand me either. They never support anything I care about. So I think I can understand where you are coming from.

what makes you unsure about the book it sounds interesting and thought provoking to me. Why do you want it to insult EVERY human in the world, surely there are some good people left.

I hate how my parents force me to go to school to learn things ill never need to know. I do get bullied quite a bit at school, the other kids make fun of me and point and laugh and pull my hair. i dont have any friends at school, i wish i had some. Maybe we could be friends? If its okay with you. i wouldnt want to be to forward. but it is nice to talk to you.

Hi Wendy,

I think I am being too harsh on the world in my new book.. And you are right, it is not condemning every human. I make many exceptions. But it still condemns their ways because they still follow the ways of the world, even if they are good people.

School is a terrible brainwashing tool used to prepare you for full-time work. I feel your pain both with school and bullying. It is terrible how people can do such horrible things, especially kids. Don't let people push you around. Stand your ground.

As far as us being friends, it depends. If you ever decide to make videos about philosophy then I would love to tutor you through life. As far as just emails, I don't really do that and I don't really think it appropriate.

Your right i should stand my ground their words cant hurt me, they are only words. Tomorrow when i go to school im going to tell them all that. Thank you for giving me the confidence to stand up for myself.
I think it would be great to make my own yt channel just like you, but i dont know as much about philosophy as you. your clearly an expert philosopher your mind is truly one of a kind. I would do sooo much to learn just half of what you know.

Hi Wendy,

Even though they are only words, they still hurt and I understand. I oftentimes think that emotional wounds are worse than physical wounds.

As far as my suggestion in making videos about philosophy, let me explain to you what philosophy is. Philosophy comes from two words, love + wisdom. Philosophy is the love of wisdom. Making videos that pursue wisdom is making videos about philosophy.

I suggest that you make videos about your life. I suggest that you discuss in these videos what you love most in life and what you hate most in life. Making videos about philosophy is merely making videos about your life and how you feel about everything.

My goal in life is to mentor a handful of young girls through video. I very much want to find young girls who want to make videos about their lives. I then want to spend the rest of my life guiding these females through life. I very much want to create a small community of young female philosophers.

Please think over what I am proposing. I ask nothing of you except your will to make videos about the topics you love most in life.

The best way to get started in this life is to become a philosopher. :)

OMG! you wont beliiieeeve this!
Today. In class i walk in and this girl Amy says "oh look, its Wendy-no-freinds" i dug my heels in to the ground i say "You think that your soo cool Amy but everyone knows your a slut who cant keep her trousers on! Nobody but God can judge me. Youd best change your ways or you will burn in hell" Ive never seen her so spechless. i sat down and the girl next to me (Eve) told me that was the coolest thing she had ever seen and we became friends right then. Then on the way home i found a £10 note wedged in the cracks of the pavement. Its the best day ive had in years. Its like God wanted me to stand up for my self that day. You knew exactly what God wanted me to do. Thank you for giving this guidance. You might have just changed my life for the better. I cant thank you enough.

I dont have a very good phone its just a dumb flip phone with no camera. Makeing a yt channel to do what you do sounds fun but i have no way of makeing videos. But i still want to learn more from you as my tutor. Your wisdom is clearly divine. Could you teach me more anyway? Please
Thank you soooo much!

Hi Wendy,

I am very proud of you for standing up for yourself. It sounds like you were greatly empowered today and you got a friend for it too. Don't be afraid of people. The more you learn about this world the more that you will realise all the people around you are complete and utter idiots. Eventually you will stop caring what the idiots think about you because you will realise how much higher you are than them. It is impossible to care about what stupid people think about you. You just need to learn how stupid they are and you won't care what they think anymore.

As far as not having a camera, then you know what you need to get. You need a camera. I suggest a portable handheld camera but you can even use a webcam in a laptop. I am fine being your tutor if your goal is to eventually make videos. My tutoring goes hand-in-hand with making videos. The videos will enlighten you as you learn more and more about yourself. Enlightenment will come from learning thyself.

Start thinking about what you want to do in your first video. Remember, these are completely yours and they are not made to make anybody happy. It is your personal space to talk about what you love and what you hate. It is for you to talk about the events in your life and digest them to understand them better. It is to talk about your feelings so you can understand how you are thinking. Ultimately, the videos will teach you right from wrong as you go through what you feel is right and wrong on camera. The first video is important because it will establish what sort of videos can be expected on your channel. Just remember to make the videos for yourself and no one else and you will do great.

I am happy to be your tutor as long as you are aiming for video work. What I have to offer is gold. What I have to offer is enlightenment. But it goes hand-in-hand with video work. You need to do the video work to understand the things I am showing you. You will remain blind to many aspects of what I teach until you get a camera out and see for yourself. To secure a tutor like myself, you need to become a video content producer. That is my job in this life. To help young girls become stars. Do this and you get me as a mentor for life.

Very proud of you Wendy for standing up for yourself. It can feel very empowering to stand up for yourself. Just remember, no one can walk all over you. You got interested in philosophy. You are big now and you can squash the bugs.

Yeah yesterday was pretty great!
Im going to have to find alot more bank notes on the ground to afford a camera, even if i could afford a camera, my perants wouldnt want me to put pictures of myself online, is it COMPLETELY NECESSARY that i make videos? What if i write about my thaughts and ideas.

I could write all about my experiences and opinions, I enjoy writing and think it could be a better way to express my feelings toward certain aspects of life, i could express all i need to in text form and you can provide feedback and tutoring to me throughout all of it. Youve written books so surly you can appreciate the value of writing

Could i please ask you a question? You havent uploaded a video in 3 weeks and i got concerned, are you ok? is there any reason why you stopped uploading? I do hope your not feeling down. If so i would do anything to cheer you up.
I would also like to ask you another question. You sound American but you are in Australia. I would love to hear about your history and origin. If you dont mined me asking?

Hi Wendy,

My objective is to save the world. Writing text will not save the world. I do encourage you to do that as it will help your personal development a great deal. But my life is invested in video. Here is how the world can be saved:

A beautiful young girl who loves philosophy starts making videos about philosophy. The world watches her make videos about philosophy from a beautiful child into a beautiful adult. The world needs to personally experience the girl growing up, becoming wiser every day as a result of making videos. My path is to help tutor young girls in philosophy through video. I am sorry but I will not be your tutor through text because then you will not be capable of saving the world. In addition, video will teach you many many more things about yourself that you never knew. Video documentation like I have done is the path to enlightenment and I am trying to show the world that by creating a small group of female philosophers to tutor. So no, I am sorry. I am not interested in being your tutor unless you do video work. As far as your parents not wanting "images" of you online, fuck them. If that is how they feel then they are retarded and they are trying to stop you from sharing your soul with the world. That isn't cool. That is why I don't like parents. That is why I don't like adults. Because they are fucking evil.

I have not uploaded videos but I described why in my latest book. I am now just focusing on writing books. My video journey has been completed until the day that I find young girls interested in philosophy to make videos with backwards and forwards. I will not be making videos in the future unless I manage to get some fangirls making videos like I am suggesting.

I am not "down". I am actually more tranquil than I have ever been in my life. I stopped caring about trying to get what I wanted. I stopped making videos trying to get what I wanted. I don't care anymore. If it is meant to be, then they will come to me and we will start making videos together. My sleep has improved greatly and I am completely off social media.

I was born in the USA but moved to Australia when I was 14. My accent is very mixed. I say some things Australian and some things American. However, I do use Australian English when typing as my academic years were spent in Australia (colour and not color).

I think you are a beautiful heart and if my method of video documentation were understood collectively, then I would have been happy to be your tutor through text. But I have a mission in life and that is to make philosophy beautiful through the beautiful girls who are interested in it. If I am never able to convince girls to do this, then that is okay. I have come to grips with failing my life mission.

So sorry, but no. I cannot be your tutor in life if you do not make videos about philosophy. And through text you would likely never discover enlightenment. Because when your eyes are reflecting back at you and you are literally talking to yourself about the subjects in life that most interest you, something in your brain clicks and the world begins making sense. There is no enlightenment found in text. That occurs when staring into your own eyes.

Well we will just have to wait until i can afford a camera.
Until then i would like to pick your amazing brain. Why did you become a philosopher? And why do you think God allows so much injustice in the world? How many other girls like me are you tutoring? Youve only mentioned tutoring girls, why is this? What is it about girls that you like so much? Do you tutor any boys? Would you tutor a boy? If not, why?
I hope im not asking to much. I just have to know more about you. You are such a brilliant and special person. I want to be closer to you, if i lived in Australia i could visit you and talk, and it makes me so sad that i cant get to talk to you face to face.

Dearest Wendy,

That is great news that you are going to invest in a camera! This makes me so happy. I will spend my life attempting to guide you to the light. I will spend my life protecting you.

I never really "became" a philosopher. I was always a philosopher. Since childhood I was always lost deep in thought. Eventually, life led me to obtain a degree in philosophy from university and commit my life to it.

God allows so much injustice in the world because this world is a test. God created a master plan in order to create a Heaven for His followers. Without this corrupt world, no heaven would be possible because there would be no way to determine who is good and who is bad. This world is so evil because it is determining whether or not you deserve eternal heaven or eternal hell. Just imagine if evil people got into heaven: it would no longer be heaven. God created a test to sort the trash from the treasure.

I speak to a handful of girls but you would be the first young girl who has committed to the project. So you would be number 1. As far as why I focus on girls, this is for multiple reasons. First, girls are the only ones with the capability of saving the world. A man obsessed with philosophy is a crazy person. But a beautiful female obsessed with philosophy is someone who can hypnotize men into their will. I focus on females to show them how to retrain men into decent creatures. I am a feminist and I spend my life fighting for equality between men and women. In actual fact, I am a matriarch and not a patriarch. This means that I believe that women should be leading the world and not men.

There are more reasons. I really like beautiful females. I want to spend the rest of my life invested in the lives of beautiful females. I was not blessed with a partner in this life and I have come to accept that I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. But that would not matter if I spent the rest of my life helping beautiful females. It is not sex that I am after - I am asexual and have no desire for sex. But just being around beautiful females and spending time with them makes my heart flutter. I very much want to spend the rest of my life invested in the minds and hearts of beautiful females.

This is not to say that I would outright refuse to tutor a male. I would just make them work very hard for it. Because tutoring a male would do nothing for my heart. I don't think males are beautiful and they are usually cocky and full of themselves. Males have no potential to save the world, so I oftentimes overlook them. I don't care about males. They are not my focus in this life. Females are my life. Not males. But it would be cool to eventually get some male students too, but they are just not my objective. They would be extra - not essential.

As far as talking face to face, of course we can. That is how this video tutoring would work. You would make a video about your life, then I would reply to your video in video form speaking about the subjects that you covered. Can you see how we will be speaking face to face? I will be looking at you replying in video form to your video. And this is how I want our community to function. I want a group of philosophers to communicate to each other through video.

I hope I have covered your questions well. And if you have committed to purchasing a camera as soon as possible, then I am now your mentor in life. Christmas is right around the corner: no better time to ask your parents for a handheld camera or a smartphone with a decent camera. I am very proud to be your tutor and I will take this responsibility very seriously, for this is no joke - this is the rest of your life. I will work very hard to empower you in this life to accomplish all of your dreams.

How odd is our names? Our names are almost identical. I am just NotSmith and you are Smith.

What is Heaven like? Who will be there?

I am so exited to begin our lessons. What are some things i should know first? What are some important areas of philosophy that i should know about first? What are some things that the system has been propagandizing to me my whole life? Knowledge is power and i want to feel your power.

As for our names... Its obvious isnt it? God wants us to be together, thats why he put one of your videos in my yt recommended. God wants you to guide me.

Hello Wendy,

Dear Wendy,

Lovely to hear from you, as always. I very much want to stand side by side with you to fight all of the evil in the world. The question is whether you do. Time will tell. If you are dedicated then we will together take on the world in this life.

I don't know all of the specifics of heaven. I have only seen the outside details. But from what I have been shown, we will be given an eternity of constant learning. Truth Is not stagnant. We make truth.

Our "lessons" begin now. You will now launch your video career. Your objective: to romance your peers into wisdom. You need to use your body, mind, and spirit to win the hearts of everybody in the entire world. This is not an easy task. How are you going to do it?

As for our names, they are very odd. To be honest, you are very strange to me and I don't know what to make of you. If you were born in 2008, then it means you are 12 years old. If your are 12, 12x3=36. Together, especially as of October 31, 2020, we together are 666.

Great teacher Wendell
I am dedicated to saving the world with you. I would dedicate my whole life to it, i would die for it.

Do you think that you and i will meet in Heaven one day?

Ive never "romanced" anyone before i dont know how, I think God had planned for you to show me. Thats why he  put your videos in front of my eyes. God knows i dont have the tools to show people true wisdom so he wants you to teach me how to guide others.

Im afraid im not sure what you mean about my age. I was born in 2008, but i think youll agree i am very mature for my age. I dont understand the significance of "12x3=36" where did the 3 come from? and how did you arrive at 666. I dont understand the significance of "October 31, 2020" either. Can you explain please?

Dear Wendy,

So, you are replying a bit quicker now. Awesome. As for dedicating your life: there is no better cause.

Of course we will meet in heaven, if your heart is aligned, however, your objective should be to meet me here on earth. See eye to eye with me so we can implement heaven on earth.

As far as "romancing", you need to learn the art of romance. Do not worry because I am here for you every single step of she way. You just have to bring another into your personality. You have to be pretty while presenting your most important issues.

As far as age, do not worry. All that I am stating is that it is very odd that I am three times older than you. That is all that I am stating. And I am 666. And at this moment both of us align with 666
