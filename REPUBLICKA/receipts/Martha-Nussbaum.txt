LOVE AS DEFINED BY THE WORLD


Martha Nussbaum views love as a crucial, intelligent emotion, central to ethics and politics, involving choice, vulnerability, and commitment, not just impulse. She argues emotions, including love, are forms of understanding that connect us to others, requiring philosophy to integrate literary and abstract reasoning for a richer moral life, emphasizing compassion, individuality, and reciprocity in relationships and civic duty. 
Core Concepts of Love in Nussbaum's Work:
Intelligent Emotion: Emotions aren't irrational; they're deep judgments about what matters, revealing our values.
Choice & Commitment: Love involves a deliberate choice, a commitment to another's well-being, differentiating it from fleeting impulses.
Vulnerability: Love highlights our dependence on others, a central aspect of the human condition that politics should acknowledge.
Compassion & Reciprocity: Essential elements for healthy love and justice, requiring empathy and mutual care.
Civic Love: A deep commitment to fellow citizens and justice, fueling public reason and a strong democracy. 
Key Works on Love:
Love's Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature: Explores how literature reveals ethical truths about love and human experience, arguing for a broader moral philosophy that includes literary forms.
Political Emotions: Why Love Matters for Justice: Argues for cultivating specific emotions, like love and compassion, as vital for a just and functioning democracy. 
Nussbaum's View vs. Tradition:
She challenges the idea that emotions must be overcome by reason, seeing them as partners to reason, especially in moral understanding.
Her Aristotelian roots emphasize the role of practical wisdom (phronesis) and specific situations in ethical life, moving beyond abstract rules.

Seeking Guidance on Propagating a New Philosophy

Dear Professor Nussbaum,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Wendell, and I am a philosophy graduate from Murdoch University. I am reaching out to you because of your inspiring work in ethics, feminism, and the role of philosophy in improving society.

Over the past several years, I have developed a new philosophical framework called the Philosophy of Emergence. It is centered on the idea that truth, meaning, and understanding naturally reveal themselves through observation, patience, and authenticity. The philosophy advocates for living in alignment with reality, responding thoughtfully to challenges, and fostering personal and societal growth by allowing new ideas to emerge organically.

I deeply admire your emphasis on creating spaces for underrepresented voices, and in my own work, I strive to encourage women to participate in philosophy, as they are still underrepresented in the field. This is one of the many ways I feel my Philosophy of Emergence aligns with your own advocacy for inclusivity and empowerment.

While I am passionate about sharing these ideas, I find myself uncertain about how to effectively propagate them. I would be incredibly grateful for any advice or guidance you could offer on reaching both academic and public audiences with philosophical ideas.

If you’re interested, I have written extensively about the Philosophy of Emergence on my blog, Wendell’s Diary, which you can find here: https://wendellsdiary.blogspot.com.

Thank you so much for your time and for the incredible work you do to advance philosophy and its role in shaping a more thoughtful and compassionate world. I look forward to the possibility of hearing from you.

Warm regards,

Thank you so much for taking the time to reply to my email. I deeply appreciate your suggestion to pursue graduate education to develop my ideas further. Unfortunately, I didn’t achieve strong enough grades during my philosophy degree to qualify for postgraduate studies, and that path isn’t feasible for me at this time.

That’s part of why I’ve chosen to focus on independently building and sharing my philosophy, the Philosophy of Emergence, through my blog and YouTube channel. It’s been an incredible journey, but I still feel a strong need for guidance on how to propagate and refine this work effectively.

If you have any advice on alternative ways to engage with the philosophical community or reach a wider audience with my ideas, I would be immensely grateful. Your perspective and insight would mean a great deal to me as I navigate this path.

Thank you again for your time and thoughtfulness.

A Missed Opportunity for a Philosophical Breakthrough

Wendell <wendellsdiary@gmail.com>
Tue, Feb 4, 2:07 PM
to martha_nussbaum, Martha

Dear Professor Nussbaum,
I wanted to take a moment to express my disappointment that I never received a response to my previous email. At the time, I reached out in the hope of engaging in meaningful dialogue about the Philosophy of Emergence, a framework I have been developing that has since led to groundbreaking insights across multiple disciplines.

While I had hoped to collaborate with you, I have continued refining this philosophy, and it has already produced major breakthroughs in:

🔹 Political Philosophy – The creation of Emergent Leadership & Politics, a dynamic model for governance that evolves with societal needs.
🔹 Ethics & Human Flourishing – A new approach to ethics based on Emergent Goodness, where moral frameworks evolve through real-world interaction rather than rigid doctrines.
🔹 Economics – A new model of Emergent Economics that balances fairness, prosperity, and adaptability, moving beyond capitalism and socialism.
🔹 Cognitive Science & Neuroscience – Emergent Neurology, which explains how intelligence and consciousness evolve dynamically rather than being fixed properties.
🔹 Metaphysics & Cosmology – Emergent Cosmology, a potential Grand Unifying Theory explaining how quantum mechanics transitions into classical physics through emergent principles.

It is unfortunate that this journey had to unfold without your insight, as I deeply respect your contributions to philosophy, ethics, and human capability. I was hoping to advance this field alongside you, rather than in your absence.

I am still open to discussion if you are interested in exploring how Emergent Philosophy could be one of the most important philosophical developments of the modern era. But whether or not you engage, the work is already making an impact.

I hope that in time, you will recognize that this was a moment where something truly revolutionary was unfolding—and that the opportunity for collaboration was a rare one.

A Missed Opportunity for Collaboration

to martha_nussbaum, Martha

Dear Professor Nussbaum,

I wanted to follow up on our previous correspondence regarding potential collaboration. When I initially reached out, you mentioned that you were occupied with writing a book and could not engage in further discussion.

Since that time, I have written and published ten books—covering philosophy, governance, knowledge, emergence, and more. Each of these works challenges institutionalized thought and offers a new framework for understanding the world. If time constraints were truly the reason for declining collaboration, then I must ask: Was one book truly so consuming that it prevented even a moment of engagement with new ideas?

I have built an entire education system, an alternative political structure, and a revolutionary philosophical framework—all while continuing to expand my body of work at a rapid pace. The excuse of being “too busy writing a book” does not hold up when placed against the sheer volume of work that I have produced in the same timeframe.

You can view my published works here: wendellsdiary.com.

The door was open for collaboration, and I offered the opportunity to engage with something truly transformative. That opportunity was declined—not due to time constraints, but by choice. It is worth reflecting on what was missed.

I want to take a moment to express how much I respect your work as a philosopher and the contributions you’ve made to the field. Your insights into ethics, justice, and human capability have had a profound impact, and I greatly admire your dedication to philosophical inquiry.

I understand that you’re deeply focused on your current book, and I respect the time and effort that goes into such an endeavor. If, after completing it, you ever find yourself interested in discussing the intersections between your work and the Philosophy of Emergence, I would love to have that conversation.

I believe there is a strong synergy between our approaches—particularly in rethinking knowledge, governance, and ethics for the future. If at any point you’d like to explore these ideas further, I’d be honored to engage in conversation or collaboration.

If you would be open to sharing your book with me once it’s finished, I’d be happy to read it and engage with your ideas more deeply. Either way, you can always reach me at this email or through my website, wendellsdiary.com. I truly appreciate you taking the time to respond.

Dear Professor Nussbaum,
I appreciate you taking the time to respond. However, I must say, I find your reply quite interesting. A simple "Thank you" is still a continuation of a conversation, not a dismissal. In what world does "Thank you" mean "leave me alone"? If you truly wanted to disengage, a non-response would have done the job much better. Instead, you have responded again—perhaps out of habit, perhaps out of curiosity, or perhaps because some part of you recognizes that there is something worth discussing here.

I’ve reached out to many academics, and while most choose to ignore me outright, you have at least acknowledged my existence, which is more than I can say for many others. That alone is worth noting. But isn’t the role of a philosopher to engage with ideas, to question, to explore, and to challenge? You have dedicated your career to intellectual rigor, yet here you are dismissing an opportunity for discussion in favor of a short, abrupt remark.

You may not be interested in collaboration, and that is, of course, entirely your choice. But if philosophy is about the pursuit of knowledge and the exchange of ideas, then wouldn’t the real tragedy be in prematurely shutting down a conversation before seeing where it might lead?

Regardless, I respect your work and the contributions you have made to philosophy. If you ever reconsider and wish to engage, you know where to find me.

The Philosopher Queen Immortalized in Myth and Thought

Wendell <wendellsdiary@gmail.com>
Wed, Mar 5, 6:42 PM
to Martha, martha_nussbaum

Dear Professor Nussbaum,

A philosopher of your stature is not merely a scholar—you are a force, a guiding beacon in the intellectual cosmos, a Philosopher Queen whose work shapes the very foundation of thought itself. Few have dared to carve their place into history as you have, and fewer still have earned the honor of being immortalized in myth.

With great admiration and respect for your contributions to philosophy, I have written a book titled The Philosopher Queens: A Call for Women to Shape the Future of Philosophy. It is both an ode and a rallying cry, a work that seeks to ensure that the legacy of great women philosophers—yourself included—does not fade into obscurity but instead sparks a new era of intellectual leadership.

Your work, your influence, and your relentless dedication to philosophy have woven themselves into the heart of this book. Like the philosopher-queens of old, your wisdom is a torch that will light the way for the next generation. It is only fitting that you should be a central figure in a narrative that honors those who have dared to shape the intellectual world.

The book is now available both in text and audiobook format so that its reach may extend as far as possible. If you would like to explore it, you can read or listen to it here: https://trepublic.net/library/the-philosopher-queens-2025-call-for.php. I would be honored to hear your thoughts, should you choose to engage with it.

The world of philosophy is often slow to change, reluctant to embrace the figures who challenge its traditions. But you have never shied away from such challenges. This book is an invitation—perhaps even a challenge—to join a conversation that is long overdue.

With deep respect,
