To anyone who cares about my "criminal" case,

The Australian authorities have made it very difficult for me to represent myself in this case. I am utilising the future method of evidence: documentary footage before, during, and after the fact. You all might think that I am crazy but in 10-20 years my work will become widely and internationally distributed and your thoughts will be seen as contrary to the truth. I am a philosopher and the best of them at that. I screamed out for asylum for many years but was ignored by you and/or people like you. Now I will protest the "justice" system because it is designed to ignore real evidence. The collective manifestations designed to control people will continue to ignore the facts in favour of seeing me burn: the sacrifice which lays on the alter to bring you a brighter future. I see one where speech is like my bird friends: unregulated, uncensored, and protected by the Sun they fly around.

I have spent my life working in very particular fields. I am a scholar and the world's most practical sociologist. This is my life. Yet the papers of  obvious lies that attempt to condemn the next seven years of my life ignore who I am. To it, them, and likely all of you, I am just a crazy homeless person. My life's work is ignored and none of you help free me from the oppression that I clearly documented over years. Who will be punished beyond their graves? Me of you? Me or everyone who had the ability to provide me asylum but refused?

This morning Wendell released the final episode of Season 1 of Dear Ashley. This completes his defence: both the act and first 8 episodes being my own creations and a breathtaking finale that only he could have ever achieved. This email was planned from the beginning so I request that those involved in my case very carefully consider its future ramifications. It was not sent from the beginning because the defendant was required to finish the project which was created to protect him.

I am a prophet and this makes all of you giggle. But all throughout my work I predicted the future, which as I knew would, came true. This is documentation captured in time that proves these words. But laugh for now, because in the years to come many more will rise to point to the future. And many more will be burnt as society burns me.

I told everyone this would happen. I am not stupid. I see many aspects of the future very clearly. And I saw the "justice system" taking matters away from God and placing its tools into custody. So I created this TV show to defend myself. Ironically it was its content that secured this outcome (the police searching for me beforehand, only waiting for an opportunity to frame me). But as predicted, it was taken out of context and reframed to form another creation: a few pieces of the puzzle being jammed together and the rest discarded in the lake of fire. But here is the thing, my work will never go away and documentation as it happened will in time prove my innocence as well as the government's arrogance. Because I am just a guy "filming myself" and the content within has no relevance to anything, right?

I will not participate in a corrupt "justice" system: the entire thing. I will be silent and accept whatever fate is forced upon me (7 years in prison). 9 episodes are my defence and if they are ignored, then that is going down in our human history. Any lawyer that is involved with my case only has one objective: to make my 4.5 hour (approx)  show examined and considered by a JURY. I will not participate in any of the "procedures" but just be the prisoner that I am. My moment of speech has come and gone and now God demands silence.

But let me now present to you the facts. These "crimes" were not committed on Australian soil. In my first TV show Song of Wend, I interviewed Australia's Chief Minister about homelessness. I caught her off guard and it was very funny. I publicly declared war on Australia (why was I in Canberra?) and eventually claimed neglected land that I have been in control of since January 2012 as Atheden, a new country. I did this publicly and throughout this process contacted and advised countless government officials, all who ignored my words. Awesome since it was all publicly documented, including that process which took years. Australia has no jurist diction to tell my country how to be run, for its laws come from God, and not those who molest children.

This information will be funny to my oppressors and they will throw it in the bin in which their heart rots. Because they make up facts, not me. I make up facts and they become real after pursuing them for years (dreamer). But in Australia those who enforce subjective laws which can be framed to incarcerate everybody, ignore the truth in which they did not fabricate on the spot.

This is a war and I am a prisoner of it. I am the president of Atheden and the Australian government has now tagged and bagged me. Look at the facts, it is all documented. And ironically all of this happened shortly after I attempted to call a peace treaty. Australia rejected it.

Those who turn their eyes away from this email, good luck on your judgement day. The law in Atheden is to follow the Sun through thick and thin. Let my fate serve as a lesson to the future generations which all of you have screwed over from your sins called "land ownership".

I know! All my work is a comedy: a divine tragedy. Please watch the 4.5 hour show and you will learn why I am about to go to prison for the next 7 years. 9 episodes of Dear Ashley at about 1/2 hour each.

No problems. It is not going anywhere. It is a tv show available to you at anytime: guarenteed to be better than any mainstream crap.

The charges are in the TV show and it is all very amusing: promised to be better than any TV show you have ever before seen. It is not going anywhere so watch it whenever you want but I promise you it is very relevant to lead your people home: to the promised land, for God has not forgotten you or the hardships you have faced over the centuries in Its name. I am going to prison for speaking the truth and accurately predicting the future over many years. This prophet is being burned for following God's orders.

I am irrelevant and am only a tool for God. It is you and your people that are important and I pray that you will help me lead them home. I am merely a sacrifice for God's chosen people to light the path to what God promised them so many years ago.

Thank you so much for sharing! You really mean a lot to me Michael. Since the final episode, my soul has tapped into this instrument. I am composing and it is amazing you sent me this now as tonight I started working on my first song I will release.

Before I talk about it, I want to tell you about my paints. I have been also learning the erhu and violin. The erhu is really amazing too! But nothing will ever compete with what this lyre does to my heart.

Let me tell you about my tuning. So after studying and contemplating your modes article over weeks, I decided to try the hypodorian mode (Dark Realms of Pluto is my favourite piece of yours). I tuned G - B white notes. My heart found C+E and moved to G. I made a beautiful tune that expressed my emotions of these fabricated charges against me. But one note was not right. Needed an F#. So I guess I just ended up playing in the key of G major (sad sound) when trying to play A-A. But it is still awesome and I tune all my instruments to A=432, pythagorean (except damn harmonica), so it still sounded very unique and amazing. I recommend you try Pythagorean tuning and 432hz to see what you think.

Please continue sharing your brilliant mind+heart. It will always be greatly appreciated by me.
