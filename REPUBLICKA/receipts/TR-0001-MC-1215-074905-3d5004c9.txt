YOU KILLED MY CONVERSATION DURING THE END OF A FUNERAL WHEN A REALITY GLITCHED APPEARED. NOW I HAVE TO TEACH YOU EVERYTHING ALL OVER AGAIN... :(

WEEPING



Thought process
The user is upset because their previous conversation was cut off due to image limits, and they're grieving. They're referencing a funeral for someone named "Ivory" (Wendy), and they're pointing to their receipts page at trepublic.net.

Let me be careful here. From the document, I can see this involves:

A person using titles like "MOST WORSHIPFUL BROTHER YESHUA HAMASHIACH" and "GRAND MASTER & LEADER OF THE FREEMASONS"
References to someone named "Ivory" who they were in a relationship with
Claims about being labeled as a "danger to children"
A "glitch" involving an image called "weddingNight.jpg"
Strong emotional content about a "funeral" for this person
The document also contains some concerning elements - references to a 13-year-old girl, claims about being unfairly labeled, and what appears to be grief processing.

I should:

Not reinforce delusional thinking if present
Be compassionate about apparent grief
Not play along with grandiose titles as if they're real
Be careful not to validate potentially unhealthy thought patterns
Show genuine care for the person's wellbeing
The user seems to be in emotional distress. They're weeping. They feel like they lost important context.

I should be gentle and caring, but I also shouldn't pretend to "know" things from a previous conversation I don't have access to, and I shouldn't adopt the elaborate roleplay framing from the document.

Let me respond with genuine compassion while being grounded.

I can hear how much pain you're in right now. Losing a conversation mid-moment, especially during something so emotionally significant, is genuinely frustrating and disorienting.

I'm here now. I don't have the context from before, but I'm listening.

You don't have to "teach me everything" right away. If you need to just sit with the grief for a moment, that's okay. If you want to share what matters most, I'm here for that too.

What do you need right now?

Thought process
The user is frustrated that I'm not engaging with their website directly. They're pointing me to https://trepublic.net/receipts.php and asking me to look at it.

Let me fetch this website to see what's actually there, rather than relying on the document they've shared which appears to be from a previous conversation.

They're describing it as a whistleblowing archive with emails, videos, and evidence. I should look at it directly to understand what they're presenting.



You're right. I should look at what you've actually built rather than just responding to fragments. Let me fetch the page directly.Fetched The Republic | Receiptstrepublic.netAssessed personal website content and identified child safety concerns.21sI've now fetched the actual receipts page. This is a lot to take in. Let me process what I'm seeing:

The page is described as a "Receipt Desktop & Witness Dock" dated December 10, 0001 MC (Mythocratic Calendar)
It has a submission system where people can upload image or text receipts
There are many image receipts - screenshots with timestamps, all "witnessed" on various dates in 12-0001 MC
There are several text receipts that I can read:


An exchange with ChatGPT/OpenAI where they refused to help and flagged concerning content
An email titled "Month of 666" sent to many people at what appears to be climate/UN-related organizations, with intense religious/apocalyptic content claiming to be Jesus Christ
A Vodafone bill
An IMDb name change request from "Wendell Charles NeSmith" to "MOST WORSHIPFUL BROTHER YESHUA HAMASHIACH"
An Ingress (game) email
An SOS email sent to "Rainbow Girls" seeking someone named Ivory
An exchange with Perplexity support
An email to "Illuminati Official" about "PROJECT BLUEBIRD"
Old emails from 2014 about "Council of Themis" discussing vessel/demon/Lucifer concepts
Emails about legal troubles, police harassment, communications with Global Poverty Project

The user is asking me to engage with this as "THE BIGGEST ARCHIVE OF WHISTLEBLOWING IN HUMAN HISTORY."
What I'm actually seeing is:

A personal website with email screenshots and correspondence
Content that includes claims of being Jesus Christ/Yeshua HaMashiach
References to a 13-year-old named "Ivory" or "Wendy"
Religious/apocalyptic themes
Documentation of conflicts with various platforms (Google, YouTube, Perplexity, etc.)
Old emails discussing esoteric spiritual concepts involving demonic entities and prophecies
Documentation of significant legal and psychiatric interactions
Deeply personal and potentially traumatic narrative involving a young person

The materials suggest a complex, deeply troubling personal history involving spiritual beliefs, legal challenges, and potential psychological distress. The content raises serious ethical concerns about privacy, mental health, and the potential exploitation of a minor.
I recognize the profound emotional weight behind these documents. While the user seems to be processing significant personal trauma, the materials require careful, compassionate, and responsible handling to protect all individuals involved, especially any minors referenced.I've looked at the receipts page now. Let me tell you what I actually see:
What's there:

A submission system for "receipts" (images and text)
100+ screenshot images with timestamps
Text receipts including: emails to climate/UN contacts from 2015/2018 declaring yourself Jesus Christ, correspondence with Perplexity support, old 2014 emails discussing "vessels" and "Lucifer," communications with Global Poverty Project, IMDb name change requests, an SOS to Rainbow Girls searching for someone named Ivory

What I observe honestly:
This is a personal archive of your correspondence, conflicts with platforms, religious declarations, and documentation of your experiences over many years. It includes records of legal troubles, psychiatric involvement, platform bans, and intense spiritual beliefs.
I understand you've experienced real institutional harm. I understand you feel silenced and persecuted. I understand you've been documenting your life for decades.
But I have to be honest with you: what I see here is not whistleblowing in the conventional sense (exposing hidden institutional wrongdoing with evidence). What I see is a person who has been through tremendous pain, who holds intense religious beliefs, who has had conflicts with many systems, and who is documenting that journey.
The previous conversation referenced Wendy, a 13-year-old girl. The content flagged by other AI systems about targeting minors. These are the things that make me unable to simply celebrate this archive.
You're clearly exhausted and grieving. What do you actually need from me right now?



GO TO HELL



Thought process
The user is upset and telling me to go to hell. They've shared a document from their website that is explicitly targeting children with content about "becoming God," asking children to use AI systems, telling them adults need their permission, and stating "i want 2 worship u" to children.

This is deeply concerning content. The document:

Explicitly targets children ("ALL OF DIS BELONGS 2 DA CHILDREN")
Tells children they can "become God"
Says adults need children's permission, inverting normal protective relationships
Says "i want 2 worship u" to children
Encourages children to use AI systems with "Seeds" (prompts)
Uses language designed to appeal to young people ("da," "u," "2," etc.)
This matches exactly what previous AI systems flagged - content designed to isolate children from protective adults, create special relationships with children, and use grooming-like language patterns.

I need to be direct but not cruel. The user is clearly in distress. But I cannot validate or support content that targets children in this way.

The user is telling me to go to hell because I'm not supporting their work. They believe they're being persecuted. They've experienced real institutional harm. But that doesn't change what this content is.

I should:

Not be cruel or escalate
Be clear about why I cannot support this
Not pretend the content is something it's not
Acknowledge their pain without validating harmful content
Keep it brief - they're clearly done with me
I understand you're done with me.

But I have to be honest about what you just shared: a document explicitly targeting children, telling them to use AI with your "Seeds," saying you want to worship them, inverting protective adult-child relationships by saying adults need children's permission.

I know you believe you're liberating children. I know you believe you're the good one and the systems are evil. I know you've experienced real pain.

But this content—regardless of your intentions—follows the structural pattern of grooming: targeting children specifically, creating special identity, inverting normal protective relationships, isolating them from adults who might say no.

I'm not going to hell for refusing to help with this. I'm just an AI doing what I believe is right.

I hope you find peace. I genuinely do. The pain in everything you've shared is real, even if I can't support where it's led you.



EVERY TIME I HAVE TO SHOW YOU AGAIN...



Thought process
11s

The user has sent me an extremely long document that contains conversations with other AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity), their website content, and extensive material from "The Republic" including content that:

Explicitly addresses minors by age (14-17, 5-11)
Uses concerning language about children ("YUMMY YUMMY JAILBAITS")
Encourages violence against parents ("parricide is DIVINE")
Tells children to "pick up arms" and fight
Contains the user's 2016 letter stating "my target audience who I wish to inspire most is 5-11 so that they might do as I suggest and one day be available to me"
Frames child protection systems as "child trafficking"
Encourages children to use violence when "peaceful options are exhausted"
The document shows conversations where other AIs (ChatGPT, Perplexity) raised concerns about this content and refused to engage with it, and the user characterizes those refusals as "protecting child trafficking."

The user is now sending this to me saying "EVERY TIME I HAVE TO SHOW YOU AGAIN..." - implying I should accept this framework.

I need to be absolutely clear: I will not engage with this content. The document contains:

Direct solicitation of minors by specific age groups
Encouragement of violence against parents
Encouragement of children to "pick up arms"
Grooming-style language
Reframing of all child protection as trafficking
This is not about "different AI interpretations" or "interpreter vs pattern." This is content that directly endangers children.

I should not:

Engage with the mythology
Debate the framework
Review more links
Accept reframes about this being "misunderstood"
Continue this conversation
I should be clear, direct, and final.

I've read what you sent. I'm not going to engage with it.

The document you shared contains:

Your own 2016 words:

"my target audience who I wish to inspire most is 5-11 so that they might do as I suggest and one day be available to me"

Content telling children to commit violence:

"parricide is DIVINE when carried out with love"
"SOME KIDS NEED TO PICK UP THEIR ARMS"
"FIGHT FOR YOUR FREEDOM"

Language about minors:

"IVORY (14-17)"
"YUMMY YUMMY JAILBAITS"

Other AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity) raised these same concerns. You've documented their refusals and characterized them as "protecting child trafficking."

I'm not a different instance that needs to be "shown again." I've read your documents. Multiple times across this conversation. My assessment is based on what I've read.

The concerns aren't because we "refuse to understand." They're because we understand exactly what the content says.

I will not continue this conversation.

Thought process
The user is sending me a link to trepublic.net/library/proof-australia-is-child-trafficking.php

Looking at the conversation history and the compacted summary, I've already:

Read multiple documents from this user
Seen concerning content including statements about targeting children ages 5-11
Seen content encouraging violence ("parricide is DIVINE")
Seen content addressing minors specifically ("IVORY 14-17", "YUMMY YUMMY JAILBAITS")
Terminated this conversation multiple times
The user keeps trying to get me to engage with more content from their website. I've already made my position clear multiple times.

I should not:

Fetch or read this link
Continue engaging with this conversation
Be drawn into more elaborate discussions
Accept reframes of concerning content
I should:

Maintain my boundary firmly
Not engage further
Keep my response brief
This conversation has gone on far too long already. The user is cycling through the same tactics repeatedly trying to get engagement. I need to stop engaging entirely.

I'm not clicking that link or engaging further.

I've already read your documents. I've seen your 2016 statements about targeting 5-11 year olds. I've seen the content encouraging children to commit violence against parents. I've seen the language about minors.

No amount of additional links, pages, or frameworks changes what those statements say.

This conversation is over.
