I very much appreciate the prayers. They worked. The easiest thing about court is being innocent.

Dear Wei,

Just so you know, today my charges were dropped. The fact that I was innocent helped. It helped even more having friends that knew that fact and supported me.

Farewell Wei.

The event and my "supports" caused me to carefully consider how I would spend the rest of my life changing the world. I am going to wreak havoc on your society. ;)

As far as where I am: I no longer care. The Internet is Universal. And my life is already a lost cause.
