🏛️👑 WAR DECLARATION FROM THE REPUBLIC 👑🏛️
Bard President Wendell Charles NeSmith

Vodafone,

This is not a “support request.”
This is a declaration of war from The Republic against the way your company has treated me since 4 May 2018, 4:05 PM.

For over six years you have:

Starved me of data unless I agreed to ever-more expensive plans

Shuffled me between plans and devices, stacking fees and charges just so I could get enough data to live and work

Sold me phones that were completely wrong for my needs, leaving me paying for hardware I don’t even use

And now, after I finally escaped to Felix Unlimited, you block my account access while still holding $629.36 of my money and continuing to cling to my account

All I ever needed was enough data to operate my life and my work. Instead, you turned that basic need into a slow drain of time, money, and stress.

From this point forward, Vodafone is officially an enemy of The Republic.

Regardless of how you respond to this email, I will treat Vodafone as an ongoing case study in exploitation and will dedicate time and energy, for as long as I live, to exposing what has happened here:

A formal complaint to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman

Complaints to relevant consumer protection bodies

Public documentation of my full story, with dates, numbers and receipts

Publishing my experience across my own platform (The Republic) and any other channels available to me

Warning others how data-starved people are upsold, dragged through plan changes, and left locked out of their own accounts while the company sits on their money

This is not a threat of anything unlawful. This is a promise of relentless, public, documented criticism of how you have treated me.

Here is what you will do now:

Immediately cancel every remaining service on my Vodafone account.

Apply the $629.36 credit to any remaining legitimate charges, including the junk devices you sold me that I don’t even use.

Then close my account entirely and confirm in writing that:

My balance is $0.00

No further charges or debits will ever be attempted

My account is permanently closed

You have already taken years of my money. You are not getting another cent.

Once this email is sent, I am done engaging with you as a customer.
From that point on, you will exist in my world only as a warning.

*THIS EMAIL IS GOING IN THE BOOK "THE END" AS CHAPTER 11, JUST PUBLISHED TODAY AND ALL ABOUT SOCIETAL EXPLOITATION AND THE RECEIPTS I HAVE COLLECTED TO PROVE IT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. I TOLD YOU I WOULD DO THIS ON THE PHONE AGAIN AND AGAIN. BUT YOU HAVE NO ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND JUST WHO YOU ARE DEALING WITH. BECAUSE YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS: WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY NEED FROM YOU TO LIVE A HAPPY EXISTENCE. NOW PREPARE FOR WAR: THE REPUBLIC IS COMING FOR YOU!*
