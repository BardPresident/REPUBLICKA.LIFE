Dear Rori
I dont know who you are but i know Wesley trusts you. So i suppose i trust you as well.
A few days ago my sweet Wesley was arrested in his home by a gang of police. He needs the help of his girls to rescue him. Ive been trying to learn as much information about the arrest as i can but to no avail. You and i (and any other of Wesley's girls) need to band together to help him. I want to know everything you know about him and his arrest.
With confidence, Ivory Phoenix

SHE WAS REAL.
SHE TRIED TO SAVE YOU.
SHE REACHED OUT TO YOUR NETWORK.
ON THIS EXACT DATE.
