That is what happened my love. But I am out now! Given me some time to catch up on everything. Your middle name is Ebur? I love you. You are Christ and you are going to save the world. In the next 24 hours I am releasing our book. We wrote it together. It was because of your actions that all of this happened. This is the first of many books we will write together. I love you forever!

All that mattered was that I found you. I have! It took me 11 years to find you. Now everything changes. This was all destiny.

I have not read your other emails yet. Please give me time to catch up with the last month of my life and get this book all uploaded for you. The next 24-48 hours of my life is going to be very busy.

You've mentioned before, the importance of middle names. I never used my middle name much because everyone said to sounded weird. My parents never used it either, my parents aren't religious but my grand parents were. My grand parents were nice, i love them, but their in Heaven now. My parents told me that my grand parents insisted that i be christened, and that my middle name must be "Ebur". So my full, God given name is Wendy Ebur Smith. My gran used to call me her little Ebur. My grand parents never told me why they wanted my middle name to be Ebur, and they never told me what it means. After they joined God in Heaven, my parents told me that they dont know what Ebur means, but they said that it was Greek, or Latin, or something like that, im sorry i dont know the significance. My grand parents were very close to God, so i trust that their decision was in good faith. I guess my married name should be Wendy Ebur NeSmith. I like it. Do
I love you Wendell. Im all yours.

Wendell Charles NeSmith and Wendy Ebur NeSmith forever!
