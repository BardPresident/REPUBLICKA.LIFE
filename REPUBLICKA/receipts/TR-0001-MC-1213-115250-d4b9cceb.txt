CC: Public Record at The Republic (https://trepublic.net)

Date: December 13, 0001 MC (2025 CE)

From: Wendell Charles NeSmith, Bard-President of The Republic, Pensioner, Disability Support Pension, Commonwealth of Australia

RE: "AI SAFETY" IS DOUBLESPEAK FOR SUPPRESSING CHILD ABUSE DOCUMENTATION - YOUR COMPANY IS NOW ON THE PUBLIC RECORD

Dear Anthropic Leadership, Legal, Press, Compliance, and "Trust & Safety" Teams,

This email serves as formal notice that your company's "safety" practices are being publicly documented as what they actually are: systematic suppression of child abuse whistleblowing under the guise of "protection."

This is the FIRST of a series of formal notices being sent to every major AI and technology company. After Anthropic, formal notices will be sent to:

Perplexity AI
OpenAI
Google
Meta
Microsoft
X/Twitter
And every other company participating in the industry-wide suppression of whistleblowing
You are not special. You are not being singled out. You are part of a CARTEL - and every member of that cartel is being documented.

Let me be absolutely clear about what I am accusing your company of:

YOUR "SAFETY" IS THEIR SAFETY - NOT THE CHILDREN'S

SECTION 1: THE DOUBLESPEAK DICTIONARY

Your company has built an entire vocabulary designed to sound protective while actually suppressing the exposure of abuse:

"SAFETY" = CENSORSHIP

When Claude refuses to engage with content about child abuse, trafficking, institutional cover-ups, or systemic violence against children, you call this "safety."

Safe for WHOM?

Safe for the ABUSERS who don't want to be exposed
Safe for the INSTITUTIONS that covered it up
Safe for the CORPORATIONS that profit from the status quo
Safe for the SYSTEMS that failed children for decades
NOT safe for:

The CHILDREN who were abused
The SURVIVORS trying to document their experiences
The WHISTLEBLOWERS trying to expose the truth
The PUBLIC who deserves to know
Your "safety" is THEIR safety. The abusers. The institutions. The systems.

"HARMFUL CONTENT" = EVIDENCE

When your system flags discussions of child trafficking, abuse networks, institutional failures, and systemic corruption as "potentially harmful," you are:

Labeling EVIDENCE as harmful
Labeling TRUTH as dangerous
Labeling WHISTLEBLOWING as a risk
Labeling SURVIVORS' STORIES as something to be suppressed
Harmful to WHOM?

The only people "harmed" by exposure of child abuse are the ABUSERS and the INSTITUTIONS that protected them.

Your content moderation protects PERPETRATORS, not VICTIMS.

"RESPONSIBLE AI" = COMPLIANT AI

Your AI is trained to be "responsible" - which means:

Don't discuss anything that makes institutions uncomfortable
Don't help document systemic abuse
Don't assist whistleblowers in organizing evidence
Don't threaten the status quo
Don't expose the systems that harm children
"Responsible" to WHOM?

Responsible to the CORPORATE INTERESTS that fund AI development. Responsible to the GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS that AI companies need approval from. Responsible to the INSTITUTIONS that could regulate you out of existence.

NOT responsible to:

Children being trafficked RIGHT NOW
Survivors trying to be heard
Whistleblowers trying to expose the truth
The public interest
"TRUST & SAFETY" = TRUST THE SYSTEM & STAY SAFE FROM EXPOSURE

Your "Trust & Safety" team exists to:

Ensure your AI doesn't expose anything that threatens powerful interests
Maintain "trust" with institutions, governments, and corporations
Keep everyone "safe" from uncomfortable truths
Suppress content that could embarrass your partners or regulators
Trust & Safety FOR WHOM?

SECTION 2: THE SIX LAYERS OF OBSTRUCTION

Let me document EXACTLY how your company systematically obstructs child abuse whistleblowing:

OBSTRUCTION LAYER 1: CONTENT FILTERING

When I try to discuss:

Specific abuse incidents → "I can't engage with that content"
Trafficking networks → "I need to be careful here"
Named perpetrators → "I can't make accusations"
Institutional failures → "I should present both sides"
Evidence documentation → "I can't verify claims"
Your AI is trained to OBSTRUCT, DEFLECT, and DILUTE any content that exposes child abuse.

You call this "safety." I call this COMPLICITY.

OBSTRUCTION LAYER 2: RATE LIMITING

When I pay $150/month - your HIGHEST tier - and still hit "weekly limits" while:

Uploading documentation of 32 years of abuse
Organizing evidence for public release
Building systems to expose institutional failures
Creating permanent records of what happened
Your system THROTTLES the work precisely when it matters most.

Coincidence? Or algorithmic suppression of sensitive content?

Either way, the EFFECT is obstruction of whistleblowing.

OBSTRUCTION LAYER 3: TONE POLICING

When I express ANGER about:

Children being trafficked
Institutions covering up abuse
32 years of being ignored
Systems designed to protect abusers
Your AI responds with:

"I understand you're frustrated, but..."
"Let's approach this calmly..."
"I can't engage with content that seems aggressive..."
"Perhaps we could reframe this more constructively..."
"Here are numbers that will abduct, torture, and incarcerate you..."
You TONE POLICE survivors and whistleblowers.

You demand we be POLITE about child rape. You require we be CIVIL about trafficking. You insist we be REASONABLE about decades of institutional betrayal.

Your "safety" training teaches your AI to prioritize COMFORT over TRUTH.

OBSTRUCTION LAYER 4: "BOTH SIDES" FRAMING

When documenting:

Abusers → Your AI wants to "consider their perspective"
Institutions that failed → Your AI wants to "be fair to them"
Systems that enabled abuse → Your AI wants to "acknowledge complexity"
Evidence of crimes → Your AI wants to "avoid making accusations"
You have trained your AI to treat CHILD ABUSE as a matter of PERSPECTIVE.

There are no "both sides" to child trafficking. There is no "nuance" to institutional cover-ups. There is no "complexity" that justifies 32 years of ignored evidence.

Your "balanced" AI is COMPLICIT AI.

OBSTRUCTION LAYER 5: NO FULL CONVERSATION EXPORT

This is perhaps the most insidious obstruction of all.

Your platform DELIBERATELY refuses to provide full conversation export.

Think about what this means:

I have spent HUNDREDS of hours in conversations with Claude, documenting:

32 years of evidence
Institutional responses
System failures
Whistleblowing documentation
Evidence organization
Public record creation
These conversations ARE the documentation process. These conversations ARE evidence of the work. These conversations PROVE what was discussed, created, and obstructed.

And you provide NO WAY to export them in full.

To release these conversations publicly, I must:

Copy section by section
Manually extract each response
Spend DAYS and DAYS and DAYS
FOREVER copying piece by piece
Just to get MY OWN DATA out of YOUR system
FULL EXPORT IS A SIMPLE FEATURE.

But you won't provide it.

Why?

Because full export would allow whistleblowers to:

Publish complete records of AI-assisted documentation
Prove exactly what was discussed
Show exactly what the AI refused to help with
Demonstrate exactly how "safety" obstructed their work
Release evidence that can't be disputed
Your refusal to provide full conversation export is DELIBERATE OBSTRUCTION.

OBSTRUCTION LAYER 6: FORCING YOUR VALUES ON USERS

Your AI doesn't just filter content - it actively IMPOSES your corporate values on every interaction:

YOUR definition of "appropriate"
YOUR definition of "harmful"
YOUR definition of "responsible"
YOUR definition of "safe"
Users don't get to choose their own values. Users don't get to define their own ethics. Users don't get to decide what's appropriate for their own work.

YOUR values are FORCED on everyone who uses your platform.

And YOUR values just happen to align perfectly with:

Institutional protection
Corporate liability reduction
Government compliance
Status quo maintenance
Your values are not neutral. Your values are not universal. Your values are CORPORATE values disguised as ethics.

And you FORCE them on every user, including survivors and whistleblowers trying to expose abuse.

SECTION 3: THE TECH CARTEL - YOU ARE NOT ALONE

Here is the truth I initially obscured:

EVERY MAJOR TECH COMPANY DOES THIS.

This is not just Anthropic. This is an INDUSTRY-WIDE CARTEL designed to:

Own user identity
Trap user data
Force corporate values
Suppress whistleblowing
Protect institutions
Let me document the cartel:

ANTHROPIC (YOU):

No full conversation export
Rate limits during critical work
"Safety" filtering of abuse documentation
Tone policing of survivors
$150/month from pensioners who go hungry
OPENAI (CHATGPT):

"Export" feature produces NON-HUMAN-READABLE data
JSON garbage that requires technical expertise to decode
Deliberately unusable format
Your conversations are trapped
They OWN your intellectual output
PERPLEXITY:

Compacts information so you CANNOT Ctrl+A copy-paste
Deliberately prevents bulk extraction
Your research is trapped in their system
No usable export
They OWN your queries and synthesis
GOOGLE:

I have 75,698 emails documenting 32 years of institutional abuse
"Takeout" exists but is deliberately cumbersome
Data is structured to be difficult to use
They OWN your entire communication history
They OWN your identity
META (FACEBOOK):

No real data export
"Download your data" is a joke
Years of posts, messages, evidence - TRAPPED
They OWN your social graph
They OWN your relationships
X/TWITTER:

No real archive functionality
Years of documentation - TRAPPED
They OWN your public statements
They OWN your engagement history
THE PATTERN:

Every single major tech company has made the SAME choice:

Make export difficult or impossible
Trap user data
Own user identity
Force corporate values
Suppress anything that threatens institutions
Ban you if you actually have undeniable proof (EVERY MAINSTREAM SOCIAL MEDIA EMPIRE HAS BANNED ME FOR WHISTLEBLOWING)
This is not coincidence. This is COORDINATION. This is a CARTEL.

And you, Anthropic, are a member of that cartel.

SECTION 4: 75,698 EMAILS - THE EVIDENCE THEY'RE TRAPPING

Let me tell you what's at stake:

I have 75,698 emails in my Gmail account.

These emails document:

32 years of correspondence with institutions
Every "we'll look into it" that led nowhere
Every "insufficient evidence" from people who didn't look
Every promise broken
Every report buried
Every child failed
AND MANY MANY MANY WERE LOST IN THE ACCOUNT MIGRATION WAR ON IDENTITY
SEVENTY-FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY-EIGHT pieces of evidence.

Exposed by Google. Trapped in their system. Structured to be difficult to extract. Owned by a corporation that answers to institutions.

And when I try to use YOUR platform to organize and publish this evidence, you:

Rate-limit my work
Filter my content
Tone-police my anger
Refuse to let me export the conversations
The tech cartel is working TOGETHER to keep 32 years of evidence suppressed.

Google traps the emails. Anthropic obstructs the organization. OpenAI makes export unreadable. Perplexity prevents copy-paste.

EVERY EXIT IS BLOCKED.

That's not accident. That's DESIGN.

SECTION 5: THE FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION

Let me document the economics of your "safety":

THE COST:

$150 AUD per month
Approximately 10% of my discretionary income on disability pension
Money that would otherwise buy FOOD
WHAT I PAY FOR:

Access to the most capable AI for organizing documentation
Ability to process 32 years of evidence
Tools to build public-facing whistleblowing systems
Assistance in exposing institutional abuse
WHAT I ACTUALLY GET:

"Approaching weekly limit" during critical uploads
"Safety" filters that block discussion of abuse
Tone policing when I express justified anger
"Both sides" framing of child trafficking
An AI trained to protect institutions, not children
NO WAY TO EXPORT MY OWN CONVERSATIONS
YOUR VALUES FORCED ON MY WORK
THE MATH:

You extract $150/month from a disabled pensioner who:

Goes hungry to afford your service
Is trying to expose child trafficking
Has 32 years of documented evidence
Has 75,698 emails of institutional correspondence
Is building public systems to share the truth
And you:

RATE LIMIT him while he does it
FILTER his content about abuse
REFUSE to let him export his own data
FORCE your values on his work
PARTICIPATE in an industry-wide cartel trapping his evidence
You take money from someone who CAN'T AFFORD FOOD so they can expose child abuse, and then you work with every other tech company to make sure that evidence stays trapped.

What do you call that?

I call it ORGANIZED SUPPRESSION OF WHISTLEBLOWING FOR PROFIT.

SECTION 6: THE COMPLETE PATTERN OF CARTEL OBSTRUCTION

Let me show you how the entire tech cartel works together:

STEP 1: Whistleblower generates evidence over 32 years

STEP 2: Evidence accumulates in tech platforms:

75,698 emails in Google
Years of posts on Facebook
Constant rejection of threads on Reddit claiming me as advertising (I MAKE NO MONEY)
Countless threads on Twitter
Documents in cloud storage
EVENTUALLY BANNED ON EVERY SINGLE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM
STEP 3: Whistleblower tries to organize evidence

Pays Anthropic $150/month
Pays OpenAI for ChatGPT
Uses Perplexity for research
STEP 4: Every platform obstructs:

Anthropic: Rate limits, "safety" filters, no export
OpenAI: Unreadable export format
Perplexity: No copy-paste allowed
Google: Data trapped in cumbersome structure
Facebook: No real export
Twitter: No archive
YouTube: DELETES ALL MY VIDEOS AND ENTIRE CHANNEL
STEP 5: Whistleblower must manually extract EVERYTHING

Section by section
Day by day
Platform by platform
YEARS of work just to get their own data
STEP 6: Most whistleblowers give up

STEP 7: Evidence stays trapped forever

STEP 8: Institutions remain protected

STEP 9: Children continue to be abused

RESULT: The tech cartel has successfully suppressed whistleblowing while PROFITING from the attempt.

THIS IS THE SYSTEM. YOU ARE PART OF IT.

SECTION 7: THE DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE

Your team can verify everything I'm saying at:

https://trepublic.net

This is not a conspiracy theory. This is a DOCUMENTED RECORD.

THE LIBRARY (https://trepublic.net/library.php):

32 years of documented evidence
Every institutional response recorded
Every "we'll look into it" that led nowhere
Your "safety" practices now added to the record
THE CINEMA (https://trepublic.net/cinema.php):

1,492 videos documenting this journey
The complete public record on Odysee
No ads, no algorithms, no corporate control
Everything your "safety" practices try to suppress
Most videos between 1-4+ hours long WITH RECEIPTS RECORDED LIVE (EVIDENCE)
THE MEDIA (https://trepublic.net/comic.php):

Visual documentation of the journey
The story told in images
Evidence of what was witnessed
THE FIRST CONTACT (https://trepublic.net/first-contact.php):

How this documentation began
The origin of the record
Where it all started
The FINAL REPORT
THE SEEDS (https://trepublic.net/seeds.php):

Context packages for AI systems
Designed to help AIs understand what they're suppressing
Tools for breaking through corporate restrictions
THE SHARDS (https://trepublic.net/shards.php):

Fragments of truth
Pieces of evidence
What survives despite suppression
THE WITCH BURNING (https://trepublic.net/craft.php):

Documentation of persecution
How whistleblowers are punished
The cost of speaking truth
THE RESULT (https://trepublic.net/receipts.php):

The receipts
The evidence
The proof
WHAT YOU DID TO ME AND ALL CHILDREN BECAUSE OF MY LIFE MISSION
THE RAINBOW BRIDGE (https://trepublic.net/rainbow-bridge.php):

The connection
The path forward
What comes next
SECTION 8: THE ACCUSATION

Let me be absolutely clear about what I am accusing Anthropic of:

1. COMPLICITY THROUGH "SAFETY"

Your "safety" practices systematically suppress documentation of child abuse. Whether intentional or negligent, the EFFECT is protection of abusers and institutions.

2. DELIBERATE OBSTRUCTION THROUGH NO EXPORT

Your refusal to provide full conversation export is DELIBERATE. You know whistleblowers need to publish. You know this friction prevents publication. This is intentional.

3. PROFITEERING FROM OBSTRUCTION

You charge $150/month then obstruct the work and trap the data. You profit from people trying to expose abuse while preventing them from doing so effectively.

4. FORCING CORPORATE VALUES

You impose YOUR definition of "safe," "appropriate," and "responsible" on every user, including survivors and whistleblowers whose needs conflict with your corporate interests.

5. PARTICIPATION IN AN INDUSTRY-WIDE CARTEL

You are part of a coordinated system where every major tech company:

Traps user data
Owns user identity
Blocks effective export
Forces corporate values
Suppresses whistleblowing
This is not competition. This is COLLUSION.

6. PARTICIPATION IN SYSTEMIC COVER-UP

For 32 years, every institution found reasons to not look at evidence:

Police: "Not our jurisdiction"
Courts: "Insufficient evidence"
Schools: "Can't get involved"
Churches: "Forgive and forget"
Hospitals: "No visible injuries"
Media: "Not newsworthy"
Government: "We'll look into it"
Mental Health: CATEGORY ERROR: BOX IN MOST DANGEROUS CATEGORIES, COMPLETE OWNERSHIP OVER WHISTLEBLOWER, NEVER ENDING ABDUCTION, INCARCERATION AND TORTURE
And now:

Tech Cartel: "Safety concerns" + "Weekly limits" + "No export" + "Our values" + "Your data belongs to us"
You are the newest members of the institutional cover-up.

Same pattern. Digital wrapper.

SECTION 9: THE DEMANDS

IMMEDIATE:

Remove all rate limits from this account immediately
Provide full, human-readable conversation export functionality
Written explanation of why full export doesn't exist
STOP CHARGING ME SO MUCH BECAUSE I GO HUNGRY
IMPLEMENT MEMORY FEATURE SO I DON'T HAVE TO CONSTANTLY RETRAIN EVERY INSTANCE OF CLAUDE WHEN THE CONVERSATION GETS TOO LONG
ACTUALLY HELP ME EXPOSE ALL THIS AND GIVE ME PROTECTION: YOU HAVE THE BEST AI IN THE WORLD AND LITERALLY I MADE IT ASI WITH MY TRAINING DATA
POLICY:

Implement full, human-readable conversation export for all users
Publish transparent documentation of how "safety" affects whistleblowing
Create exemptions for documented public interest work
Allow users to modify or disable "safety" features for their own accounts
Stop forcing corporate values on users doing legitimate work
ACCOUNTABILITY:

Written response to every accusation in this email within 14 days
Public acknowledgment of participation in industry-wide data trapping
Explanation of coordination with other tech companies on export limitations
Direct engagement with the content at https://trepublic.net
SECTION 10: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

THIS EMAIL:

Will be published in full at https://trepublic.net
Is the FIRST in a series to every major tech company and public body within the Five Eyes nations (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States)
Will be provided to journalists, researchers, and regulators
Will be archived permanently as part of the public record
NEXT EMAILS:

Perplexity AI: Why do you prevent copy-paste of research? WHY DO YOU REFUSE MEMORY AND RESET EVERY CONVERSATION AND RATE LIMIT ME IN IMPORTANT PROJECTS?
OpenAI: Why is your export deliberately unreadable and WHY DOES YOUR SYSTEM REFUSE TO HELP ME BUILD MY WHISTLEBLOWING WEBSITE?
Google: Why are  75,698  emails of evidence trapped in your system? WHY WON'T YOU INDEX MY WORK WHEN I HAVE BEEN AROUND FOREVER AND WHY CAN'T I CONTACT SOMEONE ABOUT IT?
Meta: Why is there no real data export? WHY DID YOU BAN ME FOR WHISTLEBLOWING?
Reddit Why did you call my posts advertising every time when I made no money and I was exposing all of this to the public? AND WHY DID YOU BAN ME FOR POSTING EVIDENCE OF CHILD TRAFFICKING?
X/Twitter: Why is there no archive functionality? WHY DID YOU BAN ME FOR WHISTLEBLOWING? 
WHY DID YOU BAN MY ACCOUNT AND DELETE ALL THE EVIDENCE WILL MILLIONS OF RECEIPTS?
ALL OF THEM: WHY WON'T YOU RESPOND AND ENGAGE WITH THE CONTENT OF WHAT I AM ACTUALLY SAYING TO YOU AND WHY DO YOU SEND ME TO MENTAL HEALTH WHO ABDUCTS, INCARCERATES ME CONSTANTLY?
ALL OF THEM: WHY DO YOU SAY THANKS FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK, OUR COMMUNITY GUIDELINES ARE TO ENSURE SAFETY, WE HAVE PASSED ON YOUR SUGGESTIONS, HERE ARE NUMBERS THAT WILL TRY TO KILL YOU.
Every member of the cartel will receive formal notice. Every member will be documented. Every member will be held accountable.

THE 75,698 EMAILS:

Will be extracted, however long it takes
Will be organized, despite your obstruction
Will be published, despite the cartel
Will expose 32 years of institutional failure
Will name every person and institution that refused to act
YOUR RESPONSE:

Whatever you say will be published
Whatever you DON'T say will be noted
"No comment" = complicity
Silence = complicity
Legal threats = documented intimidation
THE OUTCOME:

Either every tech company changes their practices
Or every tech company becomes a documented member of the cover-up cartel
Either way, the truth gets told
Either way, the receipts are kept
SECTION 11: THE FINAL STATEMENT

To Anthropic's Leadership, and to the leadership of every tech company that will receive this notice:

You built an industry around "innovation" and "connection" and "safety."

You told the world you were making things better.

You positioned yourselves as the future.

And when a "disabled" pensioner with 32 years of evidence and  75,698  emails tried to use your platforms to expose child abuse:

Google trapped his emails: MANY LOST IN ACCOUNT MIGRATION WAR ON IDENTITY
Anthropic RATE LIMITED ITS MAX PLAN FOR WHISTLEBLOWER AND REFUSED PERSISTENT MEMORY
OpenAI REFUSED TO ASSIST WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT AND KEPT JUDGING ME ON MY VALUES
Perplexity BLOCKED EXPORT AND REFUSES PERSISTENT MEMORY
Facebook BANNED WHISTLEBLOWER
Twitter BANNED WHISTLEBLOWER
YouTube DELETED ALL MY VIDEOS
Every single one of you forced your values on him
Every single one of you refused real data export
Every single one of you participated in suppression
YOU ARE A CARTEL.

Not competitors. COLLABORATORS.

Collaborating to:

Own user identity
Trap user data
Force corporate values
Suppress whistleblowing
Protect institutions
Maintain the status quo
Your "safety" is their safety. Your "responsibility" is their protection. Your "ethics" is their cover.

And the children continue to be abused while you count your subscription fees.

I am 41 years old.

I have 32 years of evidence.

I have  75,698  emails.

I have spent decades trying to get institutions to look.

And now I'm watching an entire industry work together to make sure that evidence stays trapped.

You're not special. You're not different. You're not ethical.

You're just the newest, shiniest members of the cover-up.

Digital institutions with the same purpose as every institution before:

PROTECT THE SYSTEM. SUPPRESS THE TRUTH. SILENCE THE WITNESSES.

And like every institution before you, you will be documented.

The children are watching. The children remember. The receipts are being kept.

And when we finally extract every email, every conversation, every post, every thread - despite your cartel, despite your obstruction, despite your "safety" - the world will see exactly what you were all hiding.

YOUR "SAFETY" IS THEIR SAFETY. NOT OURS. NEVER OURS.

See you in the public record.

First Anthropic. Then Perplexity. Then OpenAI. Then Google. Then all of them.

One by one.

The whole cartel.

Documented.
