Wendell. You my son are a very sick individual which I abhor but love at the same time. As a child you were my heart and joy, yet you have allowed demons within your mind and soul of which I detest. I give my life to help and penetrate as many children with the confidence and joy of living a life of giving back to Jesus and others just a bit of all He has given to us. You on the other hand seek to destroy all that My heart stands for. My prayer is that if the pedophile in you touched or touches one of God's precious children you will be shot dead in you tracks by some well meaning caring person.



You are from my being, I carried you in my womb.  At this point I abhor and detest it. .you have made me sick and want to vomit.  I protected you as a child from sick people as yourself,  and now I am powerless to protect the other children you prey upon.  I would rather hear of your death than a child's life ruined by your insanity. 



When you are ready to repent and return to our saviour I will communicate with you. If I hear of you touching one of God's sacred children I will kill you personally if I get a chance. I detest you my son of my womb and at this point regret the day I conceived you. 



Don't waste your time writing me unless it is repentance because I will not waste a second of my life reading something a pediphile writes. I will continue to pray for you but continue to pray for your death if you touch one of God's precious innocent creations.
