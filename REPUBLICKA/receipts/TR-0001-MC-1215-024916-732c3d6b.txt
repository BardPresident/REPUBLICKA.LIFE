WELCOME AGENT WendellNeSmith
The global struggle for control of XM and human Mind Units continues. We trust that you'll find this intel useful.
ASSEMBLE THE PASSAGE
Agents, don’t miss your opportunity to create a once-in-a-lifetime passage to a new universe. Join us at Camp Navarro in California or Schloss Kaltenberg in Germany for Epiphany Night 2018 from May 25 to May 27. If you’re planning on attending, share your social plans with us on G+ or other social media channels with #EpiphanyNight2018. See you there, Agents!

FAMILIAR FACES ON EPIPHANY NIGHT
Through our intelligence gathering efforts, we have learned that P.A. Chapeau and Oliver Lynton-Wolfe will be appearing at the Camp Navarro Epiphany Night. What’s more, sources indicate that the current head of the NIA, explorer Hank Johnson, as well as the Enlightened spiritual leader the Acolyte, will be present at Epiphany Night in Schloss Kaltenberg. But there is a perplexing element to this intelligence -- it seems to be coming from the other universe. Could the anomalous nature of those two areas sustain passage from another Universe? We must go deeper...

AN INSIDE LOOK AT PORTAL PROJECTS
Portal Luminance Projects continue to take form as Agents from both Factions create complex displays for Camp Navarro or Schloss Kaltenberg.

Team NorCal has made a call on behalf of their project, Project Pharos, which will be displayed at Camp Navarro. Visit your local lighthouse and send the team a postcard via the address on their website -- submissions will be featured in the final display.

Team Orbis Ludens shared a few photos of the construction of their own Portal Luminence Project, which will portray the archetype of The Explorer. Agents will be able to see the final results at the Schloss Kaltenberg event! Interested in Portal Luminance Projects? Take a look at all submitted displays on the event websites: Camp Navarro | Schloss Kaltenberg.

FANTASTICAL FIELD ART
A team of Enlightened Agents in the Ukraine used elaborate field art to tell the story of the creation of Lviv in honor of its anniversary. Tales say that the Prince Lev was forced to fight a raging dragon during the construction of the High Castle. And, when he was successful, he ordered the church to build a cathedral in honor of Saint George, who himself had notably slayed a dragon. Great work, Agents!

A SPECIAL XFAC STARBURST
Every year in Colorado, Agents throughout the state get together for the Cross-Faction (XFAC) Colorado Ingress Agent Awards. But this year, it happened alongside a global challenge: requiring 250 links per faction from a starburst, with cross faction efforts to be rewarded. Understanding the value and talent found among them, Agents sprung into action once the event wrapped up, creating links back to the identified destination portals in order to create a starburst as they returned home. Five hours and 600 keys from start to finish, the starburst took amazing form. We love it, Agents!

WHERE DID INGRESS TAKE YOU TODAY?
Agent Janet Young snapped a few sunlight-drenched photos of Garn Fawr in Pembrokeshire, Wales. With just a short walk along the coast, the fort within Garn Fawr is thousands of years old and also served as a lookout point during World War I. What a spectacular view, Agent!
Where did Ingress take you today?
The Glyph Hunter, Ishira, detailed a story of traveling along the coast of California and the Pacific Northwest, with the intent to complete eight different Ingress missions. However, a logistical misunderstanding grew the mission load to twelve! Still, she forged on and explored some new places along the way in both California and Oregon. We admire your perseverance!
Where did Ingress take you today?
Agent Nelkon went to great lengths in order to create an Ingress field from the Netherlands to Germany -- about 200 km, to be exact. So, he managed to craft strategic power-napping opportunities along his route back from Dortmund, including stopping at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Memorial! With a few power naps and portal hacks under his belt, he made it safely back to Cologne. Nicely done, Agent!
Where did Ingress take you today?
Where will Ingress take you, Agents?  Use #WhereDidIngressTakeYouToday and let us know.  We can’t wait to see more reports from the field!
