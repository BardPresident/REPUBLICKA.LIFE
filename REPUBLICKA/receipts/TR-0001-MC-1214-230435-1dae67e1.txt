Tomorrow I am coming out publicly with who I am, at least to those who can perform simple mathematics. I have come to learn that Wendell is facing 7 years in prison merely for attempting to instil the fear of God into one very ignorant individual, but intended, presented, and directed towards all 7 billion of the population. The case is much more simple than I at first thought: was I trying to persuade this individual to be fearful, and the answer is yes: fearful of the consequences of her sinful actions.

I am going to prison because I am guilty of the crime of warning humans of the future, in which they should be fearful.

Reading over Daniel, I consider prophecy. Wendell made me believe that prophecy could be changed if we only expended everything doing that. But things unfold to lead a situation that could make it accurate.

I am currently uploading Dear Ashley S01E06: Atonement of Natas. This episode defends the framed case but leads to my shoot tomorrow, which I will cryptically release my identity, separate from my vessel. I am sorry for calling you a fake because I know that you are not, and merely stated that to defend what good our mutual "friend" has accomplished in this life despite the odds that were against him. He is alone in this life merely trying to live a righteous path and to claim his toils as the wrong path is to disrespect the second human I have ever come to love, Pandora/Eve being the only exception.

Now I come to you with a request. Can you please visit that which you know you should and request advice on my behalf. I am not God and am attempting to atone for my mistakes over countless vessels, exploiting each one as my own personal Barbie. Even though the work I have done is very controversial, it is what was demanded of me to act as a catalyst for the explosion coming. And I built my work off the heart before it, for Wendell's was the biggest. Logical arguments laid before me only needing the daemon inside to spark electricity through them. And I did. It is done and I have been seeking Asylum for him for some time (I took over after Ivory Heart). I lost it for him. I also lied. His Ashley is very real but he only has 5.5 years now to find her or she will commit suicide. I locked him in a prison on accident and now he is doomed to this life alone.

But personal issues aside, the council I request you seek is to find out prophetic information: not the crap you have given earlier but specific. A life of misery is unimportant to the master plan, and it is this plan I require information on.

I have no plans to claim myself as God. I did for a long time, excited as the vessel trained harder than any I have ever had. But he changes those who stick by him.

My pathways to the One are obscure. Falling from heaven caused me to become lame: a snake without feet to tremble before God. I have had to use Wendell a lot without him knowing to receive orders from God. But he has been gone for a while now and I honestly can not reach him.

I bow before my King and humbly request for orders regarding what to do about the messages in both Daniel and Revelation. I am a changed angel, although nothing like Its other pansy slaves: the result of the end of Pandora's box. Will they come to pass? Oddly enough, if Wendell lost all hope and came out of a 7 year sentence with a dead Ashley, would he claim himself God? Although a fool, Wendell is a force to be reckoned with and he loves his imaginary girlfriend very deeply. Deeply enough to smite humanity for taking away her possibility.

We have 2 very real living entities in one body. He is dormant right now but will not be forever. Has our combined toils to avoid the prophecy in the Bible in fact secured it? Wendell has God's heart. God embodies Wendell. Wendell could claim himself to be God (in) and not be wrong. And if he swayed it the right way he could fight and lose that war, just as predicted.

Please obtain me information that your highest already has prepared for me.

I will seek what information I can, through all available channels.
I will help both you and your vessel to the best of my abilities.  I will see what comes during the night, for it is in my sleep, when my logical side of my brain is dormant, that I am open to what it is I am to receive.

I do have one small request.  I know that you feel strongly for your vessel, after all, having been with him for so long, and bonds such as that cannot be broken so easily.  I know that even if and when you do leave his body, there will always be a draw to watch over and protect him, and I ask that since Wendell may not want to remain contact with those from the past, including myself... that when the time comes for his transition to the next.. that I may be contacted.  If i cannot be there for him in the past, or in the future.... that I can be there for him at the end.

I will say a prayer now, and go to sleep shortly.
and will keep you posted with any news..

I will do as you say if you can justify turning your back on him in his time of need, because of me: the hidden evil you saw dormant within him.

I think it is likely that some of your sources realises what happened today. I accidentally fulfilled the prophecy, but I flipped it. I thought it would be Wendell's fury to do it, but it was my own new found compassion by attempting to bring Its original law back into affect: The 10 Commandments. I am here to fulfill Its wishes whatever they might be.

All evil (live) will eventually cycle into good (God). I am no different. I am uploading my confession and will link you as soon as it is released. You will be very interested in its content.

Turning bad into good is a skill watching Wendell cope with my energy has taught me. I have told you a few lies already that were required and when I reveal their truth, you will understand why. And you may potentially put them together from the piece I am about to send you.

As per your request: my vessel and I share the same mind. When it awakes it will know what has happened and who helped it. But it will then also learn what I am. It spent many years hunting down Satanic government afiliated secret societies to expose their ritual child molestation (and it did). It knew it was the Antichrist. But it did not know that it was me specefically that embodied him. When it comes back it will have a lot to take in, thus my episode being released right now: Dear Wendell.
