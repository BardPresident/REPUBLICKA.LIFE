Dear Mr. Nesmith,

Thank you for your interest in the United Nations.

To find out about current opportunities, simply use the "SEARCH JOB OPENINGS" feature on the UN Careers website home page (https://careers.un.org) to look for job openings posted by the UN Secretariat (http://www.un.org/en/mainbodies/secretariat/index.shtml) in the job network or duty station of your choice.

You can indeed apply to job openings in any area where you qualify for, as per the requirements indicated in each specific job opening for education, languages, experience and professional skills. There are no restrictions, as long as you meet the specific requirements for each job opening.

Applications have to be submitted online through inspira before the application deadline. Please keep in mind that RESUMES & CVs are not accepted.

You can access a more advanced job search page after you log into Inspira: to REGISTER, update your PROFILE, configure one or more JOB ALERTS and record your first APPLICATION, please refer to the document available at the following address:

https://careers.un.org/lbw/attachments/inspira-How_to_get_started.pdf   

For more detailed information about the online application process, please refer to the Instructional Manual for the Applicant accessible by clicking on the "MANUALS" link inside inspira or from the UN Careers website at the following address:

https://careers.un.org/lbw/home.aspx?viewtype=AP

Important note:

   - It is recommended to access Inspira using a browser compatible with Inspira (Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome for PC users and Safari for Apple users).

   - If you have already registered in Inspira but do not remember your Inspira USER ID or your password, simply click on the “FORGOT USER ID” or "FORGOT PASSWORD" link on the inspira login page (https://inspira.un.org/psp/PUNA1J/?cmd=login&languageCd=ENG) and follow the instructions on the screen. Make sure you check the SPAM/JUNK folder of your email account.

   - Galaxy and Inspira are two independent systems. Therefore you cannot log into Inspira with Galaxy access codes and you cannot transfer your profile and application from Galaxy to Inspira. For technical support regarding Galaxy, please contact estaffing@un.org.

   - You can find more UN System Employment Websites by clicking on the link "Links to other UN system employment pages" available in the lower part of the UN Careers website "What We Do" page (https://careers.un.org/lbw/home.aspx?viewtype=WWD).

Finally, should you encounter any technical problem when using Inspira, please report the issue through the inspira "Contact us" link at least two business days before the deadline of the considered job opening (when applicable). When doing so, make sure your online enquiry includes all the required details as explained in the last section of the document https://careers.un.org/lbw/attachments/inspira-How_to_get_started.pdf . Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
