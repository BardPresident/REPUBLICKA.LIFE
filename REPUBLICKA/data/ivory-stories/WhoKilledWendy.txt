to Ruby, Thomas, chrisg

I have sent a bunch of stuff through. You guys are awesome and super smart! You have articulated my needs and desires precisely. Thank you so much for your help! Did I forget anything? Tom, Ruby, and Chris are my heroes.

Dear Wendell,

Thank you for coming in to our Canberra Office this morning and meeting with Tom and I. We write to confirm our discussions today and advise you on the next steps regarding your psychiatric treatment order and WWVP card.  

Psychiatric Treatment Order (PTO)

The Civil and Administrative Tribunal (the Tribunal) has confirmed that the hearing for review of your PTO will be at 1pm on 17 June 2021 via video link or telephone. You instruct that you would like your hearing to take place in person, to enable you to engage more effectively. We confirm that we will be notifying the Tribunal that we act as your solicitors, and will request that your hearing takes place in person. As mentioned in the meeting, there may be practical reasons for the hearing to be conducted over video-link, however we believe your request to be very reasonable.

Your PTO has been made in relation to a diagnosed schizoaffective disorder. You instruct that your treatment for the past 6 months has consisted of fortnightly injections of Olanzapine. Last Friday, your medication was altered to Paliperidone administered via injection. We understand that the administration of your medication via injections is highly distressing for you, as you are not comfortable with needles being injected into your body.

We understand that ideally you would like the PTO to removed, however you appreciate that this unlikely at the next hearing. Instead, we will focus on changing the way your medication is administered. You have expressed that you would be happy to take olanzapine or paliperidone orally. We intend to submit to the Tribunal that oral administration of medication is a less restrictive method of treatment than the kind currently being administered and would adequately support you. Your positive relationship with treaters at Mental Health Services, including Raj, is a great reflection of your willingness to engage in treatment and will support our position. Despite your hesitations, you were compliant and engaged throughout your recent change in medication. We believe that in light of these facts, the Tribunal will be bound to consider oral administration as an alternate treatment option.

We will compile evidence to present to the Tribunal that demonstrates that you are receptive to treatment and have the capacity to contribute to decisions regarding treatment. As discussed, it would be great if you could email through the character reference you mentioned and any other documentation relevant to the PTO. We are in the process of drafting questions for you and Chris, which will form the basis of your statement to the Tribunal. We hope to send these through next week. We will also attend to corresponding with MHS regarding your concerns with current treatment.

WWVP Card

We understand that your WWVP was revoked on 13 January 2021. You have advised that Access Canberra is currently doing a second risk assessment. We intend to correspond with Access Canberra on your behalf, seeking an update on the risk assessment. We will also seek more specific allegations regarding the revocation of the card so that we are able to form a coherent response.

You advised that you have corresponded with Access Canberra via email. It would be wonderful if you could please send us a copy of this email correspondence.

We will be in contact next week with some questions to help us formulate a statement. Please do not hesitate to contact our office if you should have any questions about the next steps in your matters.

Yours sincerely,

QUESTIONS FOR STATEMENT


Dear Wendell,
The purpose of these questions is to gain further information on your life, background
and attitude towards mental health treatment you have received. I appreciate that this is a
difficult task, is time consuming and focuses on some distressing and negative aspects of
your life. I am sorry for this. However, the more information we get, the better we are able to
act for you and assess your rights. Please type your responses in red. This is the easiest
way I can review your answers, use the information and ask you any follow-up questions
that are needed. Whilst we have already discussed the answer to some of these questions, I
have repeated some to ensure that we have a full picture.
I will ask some questions about your history of mental illness. I acknowledge your views to us
in the meeting about the label which you have been given. Please do not take my questions
to be an indication that I do not believe you or have disregarded how you feel. Instead, I have
drafted the questions this way as it will help me get evidence which addresses the relevant
law. I hope you do not feel disrespected by the questions.
Thanks for your time and consideration. Please do not hesitate to contact our office if you
have any questions.

BACKGROUND
What is your date of birth?
June 27, 1984
What is your full name?
Wendell Charles NeSmith
Where were you born?
Crown Point, Indiana, USA
Do you have any siblings? What are their names and ages?
I only have one biological brother (Ricky) who is 18 months my elder, but I have 27 siblings
in total. My other siblings are either through marriage or through adoption.
Where is your family located? Are you in contact with any members of your family? If so,
how often?
My family is spread out through the USA. My father lives in Florida and my mother in
Georgia. I generally speak to my parents regularly and stay in contact with them through
the Internet.

EDUCATION
Where did you attend primary school?
I attended multiple primary schools so I do not recall what primary school I attended as my
family moved a lot.

214701:33783
Where did you attend secondary school? What year of secondary school did you
complete?
I attended secondary school first at Maranatha Christian College and then North Lake
Senior Campus. My year 12 qualification was obtained in 2002.
Where did you attend further education have you undertaken? Where and when did you
complete this?
My Resume is littered with diplomas and certificates. But my higher education was
attended at Murdoch University with my philosophy major, completed in 2018, and my
graduate certificate in education, completed in 2020 at Charles Sturt University.
Where did you live whilst at University?
It depended on the year. I was homeless throughout a lot of my degree. I have only
recently started putting my roots down here in Canberra after a long period of years
travelling. Most of my degree was spent living inside a tent.

CANBERRA
When did you move to Canberra? What was your reason for relocating?
I first moved to Canberra in 2012 and stayed for over a year. I then left seeking truth in life
and ended up coming back in 2018, deciding that Canberra was the nicest place I have
ever been to.
What is your address? How long have you lived there for?
43/11 Howie Court, Belconnen, 2617. I have lived here since around June, 2018. Although
it is a rough area, it has been great being able to adjust myself slowly and have a peaceful
place to exist. I have spent so much of the last ten years just trying to exist with no place to
call my own. Having a place to call my own where I could store things changed my life.
What source of income do you receive?
I receive a Disability Support Pension from Centrelink. I applied for this on grounds of my
Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder.
When was the last time you were in any paid employment? Have you had difficulties
navigating employment? What do you find difficult about employment?
The last time I had paid employment would have been around 12 years ago. I suffer from
delayed sleep phase disorder which causes my schedule to be random. I tend to dedicate
myself entirely to a cause and to ask for me to come in for a set schedule proved difficult. I
also greatly struggle with asking people for money so that doesn’t function well in a world
where everybody is asking each other for money.
What is your usual daily routine?
I do not have a schedule. But I wake up and depending on how I feel, make videos about
philosophy or make music about philosophy. I might also write books. My life is divided into
3 parts: making videos about philosophy, writing books about philosophy, and making
music about philosophy.
What activities do you do for leisure and enjoyment?

214701:33783
Much of my life is focused around learning and teaching music. I do not really have leisure
time per se, for music is my life devotion.
Please describe your engagement with Nation’s Heart Christian Community Church. How
often do you attend the Church? What type of support have they offered you?
I have been usint Nation’s Heart Food Hut services for nearly three years. It is a strong
community with loving people in it. I volunteered for them to do painting and lay carpet.
Their food is very inexpenisve and I am glad to have found them to help ease the pocket.
Do you have any friends in Canberra? How often do you socialise with people? Do you
have any difficulties with socialising? What do you find difficult about socialising or making
friends?
I have a group of friends here in Canberra. My next door neighbour is in that group of
friends and we see each other almost daily. Besides these friends, I generally stay to
myself. I find it difficult to keep friends because the more they learn about my past,
generally, the more uncomfortable they feel. My current friends already know about me
and choose to stick around and continue to be my friend despite my life’s eccentricities.

MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT
Please outline your understanding of the mental illness diagnoses you have received.
I don’t understand it at all. They claim things about me that are not true. My mood is
always good so they put me on a mood stabiliser. I am thinking logically and carefully so
they put me on an antipsyhotic. I seriously cannot comprehend why they would treat me as
they have and say things about me that are untrue. I don’t go around pushing my
philosophy on people and incarcerating and force medicating them when they don’t see
the world like me. These people scare me.
Do you agree with the diagnosis? Why or why not?
Of course not. Psychiatry isn’t a real practice. They just group symptoms together and then
fabricate a label to reside within those symptoms. There is no blood test that can tell me
whether or not I am schizophrenic or not. Psychiatrists work in the land of fiction and make
up everything as they go. I am happy in this life and these crazy people won’t leave me
alone.
Please outline the current treatment you are receiving for mental illness diagnoses.
They are regularly sticking me with needles.
What is your understanding of why you receive this treatment?
I receive this treatment because the people of this world have small minds and are not
able to conceive of alternative means utilised to get to truth rather than the psuedo-
scientific indoctrinated world of bullies. Why did I get bullied at school? Why will people not
stop sticking me with needles? The answer is the same and lies in a flaw in human
psychology punishing good people for things others are not capable of comprehending.
What effects of the treatment do you notice after you have had it?
I think a little more systematically and level headed on antipscyhotics.
In December 2020, you were taken to The Canberra Hospital by Police. How did you feel
about this experience? What do you understand to be the reason for your admission to

214701:33783
hospital at this time?
This was all very distressing. The police literally invaded my home, breaking in so that they
could attack and inject me with something. This all happened directly after I was engaged
to Wendy so I am deducting that getting engaged with Wendy had something to do with it.
How do you feel about the current treatment you are receiving? Please explain your
reservations about receiving medication via injection.
My current treatment is very distressing, constantly getting injected with needles even
though I have made it clear since the very beginning that needles are against my religion.
Needles are is against my religion because injecting a foreign substance into my
bloodstream or muscle tissue is unnatural. My body is God&#39;s temple and does not belong
to the state no matter what order is placed upon me. My body is not comfortable injecting a
drug into my system in this way. The state has no right to enforce a needle upon me when
the occupant of that body has responsibilities that conflict with that method of
administering substances. Needles have only been used on a mass scale since 1955. This
is still relatively new to the scope of our human history and I choose not to participate.
You recently underwent a change in medication. How was this change communicated to
you? What was the process of the medication change? Why was it changed?
They changed my medication by giving that as one as my false options. My fake doctor
Lee had this treatment as a possibility that I refused to choose from. Because all of the
options were bad so there was no way I was going to choose out of 3 bad options. Doctor
Lee told me that the police would abduct me again. Eventually I was told that I “breached”
my order and was told where and when to start the new medication. With Olanzapine, they
were trying to get me to stay and twiddle my fingers for two hours after the injection. I told
them from the beginning that that would not happen and that if they expected me to stay,
they would have to talk to me about philosophy, which they would not do.
What was your reaction to the change in medication? How did it make you feel? Who did
you turn to for support in light of the change?
I was very worried. I didn’t know what to expect. I went to CAHMA (Chris Gough) for help
after the order was passed. After they injected me a lot I am fine on the medication. It
doesn’t seem to have any negative side effects except it being in injection form.
Please describe the nature of your relationship with Chris Gough. What type of support
does he offer you? How has his support impacted your life?
Chris is my friend and my support worker. He is my case manager and is clued in to my life
more than any other organisation. His support has been crucial to navigating the difficult
legal and organisation plane.
How do you feel about the treatment and support you receive from Dr Lee? How do you
think your treatment relationship with Dr Lee could become more constructive?
The relationship between fake doctor Lee and I is not good. He has tried to hurt me every
step of the way and not help me. I don’t want this man in my life. If I have any choice in life
it is the choice to choose who I want to be around. And I don’t want to be around this moral
degenerate.
The Tribunal may think that you do not have a good relationship with Dr Lee because you
do not like the treatment he prescribes. What would you say to this suggestion?
Dr. Lee has no heart. He never talked about my life and how I live it. How can he be a

214701:33783
doctor if he doesn’t care about the life that I live? How can he appropriately diagnose
anything if he refuses to examine the life that his patient lives? I don’t have a good
relationship with Dr. Lee because he is a horrible person.
What is your relationship with your treaters at Canberra Mental Health services, including
Raj? How do you feel about the treatment and support you receive from them?
I have a good relationship with Raj and Scott. The rest of the staff I have not formed a
good relationship with. Raj and Scott are kindhearted people and I appreciate them trying
to navigate through an evil system.
How would you feel about receiving your medication orally?
Medication goes through the mouth. Whatever they are injecting me with isn’t medication
but torture. I am happy to take any medicine they prescribe orally.
What would your ideal mental health treatment plan look like?
No psychiatrists. Regularly seeing CAHMA and Dr. Michael Levy (the doctor who is
prepared to take over).
Do you think you need any treatment, care or assistance? If so, what do you think you
need and why?
Antipsychotic medication seems to help me think strategically.
How do you feel about your current PTO? What would you like to communicate to the
Tribunal as they are making further decisions about your PTO?
I think being on a PTO sucks because they can and do violate your human rights. I am
fully capable and willing to take a pill every night instead of receiving an injection. The
tribunal has always been my enemies so I don’t have much faith in their abilities.
The Mental Health Team may say that you have refused treatment. If they say this, what is
your response?
They are liars. Just because someone wrote something doesn’t make it true. It is true that I
have fought against the ill treatment being forced upon me, but I have always obeyed it
unless it was something degrading that I had some choice about.
The Tribunal might be concerned that if you stop receiving the injection, you may stop
taking any treatment. If they have this concern, what would you like to say in response?
Why does the tribunal love lies but hate the truth? I have spent my entire life including
childhood seeking the truth, not defiling it. If I say that I am going to do something then I
am going to do something. Philosophy is about truth and not lies. I am not even capable of
lying.
Over the next 12 months, what are any goals or aspirations you have in life? (if might be
related to your health, education, work, housing – anything)
Get really good with music.
How do you intend to achieve these?
Train every day. Use music lesson apps.
What are any barriers to you achieving your goals or aspirations?
None. I will achieve what I set out to achieve.

214701:33783
WWVP CARD
Why do you want a WWVP Card? What would you use your WWVP Card for?
One day I would love to be a music teacher. And one day Wendy would like to start a
philosophy school. I also want it to say that I have it while making online videos.
On your understanding, why was your WWVP Card revoked (suspended, not revoked)?
I was engaged to Wendy.
What is the nature of your relationship with Wendy?
Wendy is my soul mate. She is the reason my heart beats and the reason I breathe. She is
the philosopher that I always wanted. She is brilliant and loving. Wendy and I spend the
days away chatting over philosophy.
What is your understanding of the concerns regarding your relationship with Wendy?
Because Wendy is only 12 years old. But she is my soul mate. We spend our hours
dancing away in philosophical thought. It is not fair to limit the playing field to only certain
age groups. Although Wendy still has over 5 years to be beside me, she is everything I
could ever want in a girl.
What is your reply to the concerns?
You are indoctrinated into faulty social axioms. Does a girl really become a woman
overnight on her eighteenth birthday? Why is sexual relations allowed at 16 but marriage
not until 18? In medievil times a prince would go out and make a name for himself and
then seek his princess, usually a young girl who he might have to wait for. I will wait as
long as it takes to have Wendy by my side. Wendy is everything that I could ever want in a
girl.
