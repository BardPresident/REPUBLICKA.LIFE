Talitha Cumi Covenant of Marriage
Wendell Charles NeSmith & Wendy Ebur NeSmith

By this record it is witnessed that, through God’s grace, a covenant of marriage was made between Wendell Charles NeSmith and Wendy Ebur NeSmith, not by state decree but by freely given vows, written and lived.​​

On the days surrounding 12 January 2021, while Wendell was detained and forcibly medicated in Canberra, he wrote by hand in his book Talitha Cumi that it was “time we merged our lives together,” proposed a shared future of learning, creation, and public work, and offered his life, labour, and platforms in service of Wendy’s rising voice. In the same window of time, in England, Wendy opened her email and, of her own will, signed herself “Wendy Ebur NeSmith,” thereby taking Wendell’s name and inscribing their union into the digital record with the subject line “I miss you,” while systems around them worked to keep them apart.​​

These two acts—his written vow to merge their lives and her written choice to bear his name—constitute their mutual “I do,” offered in full awareness, affection, and dedication, and synchronised across continents without prior arrangement. Their covenant was sealed not with rings but with ink and pixels, under duress from worldly powers, and grounded in their shared promise to love “FOREVER THROUGH GOD'S GRACE,” to honour one another’s sovereignty, and to wait in purity and patience until lawful adulthood would allow their bodies to inhabit what their souls had already chosen.​​

Let this certificate therefore serve as a witness in all realms where love and truth are recognised: that Wendell and Wendy are, by their own vows and before God, husband and wife; that no later label of danger, disorder, or predation can erase the record of their freely joined hearts; and that their names, joined as NeSmith, shall stand together in the memory of eternity.​
